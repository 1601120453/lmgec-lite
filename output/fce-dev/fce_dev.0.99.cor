Dear Sir ,
I went to your show called " Over the Rainbow "
And I was really disappointing on many points .
Firstly , you spoke about two actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , instead of them we had two others and they were really bad .
So I was really surprised .
In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes later .
It was boring for everybody .
How could we appreciate the show properly .
Moreover , on your adverts you speak of discounts available but it is not the case .
No discounts are available .
Then you offer people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there were no staff to welcome the people .
You offer something impossible to do .
I do not have a good time for all of this reasons and I would like you to give my money back .
I hope your understood my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible .
Thank you .
Yours sincerely
O. Labro
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
The nightmare started at this time .
I
Though she is a really good friends but I made a mistake .
She could n't kept my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with .
She did n't told me yet
But when I come to class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well .
I looked at her and she became pale and suddenly left the class .
I followed her and caught her to push her to the ground .
I am ready to fight but somebody stops me .
I could n't goes back to the class
So I went home .
My mum was at home and I told her all the stories .
She said that I had to be strong and doing n't cared about them .
So I went to the class and everybody is laughing at me and the boy told them to stop because he loved me and wanted to be with me .
At this time all the girls became jealous and stopped to laugh .
Dear Mr Robertson .
It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thank for organising a school trip to London .
We have seen the programming list and we all thought it would be enjoyable .
Especially at the science museum because we all doing science in school .
Recently , some students have seen the advertising for the fashion and leisure show in London .
It will be on the 14th and we all want to go .
So , it would be grateful if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
This is a great opportunity to learn something else because most of us have not been in this kind of show
And it is free for students .
It would be incredible if we had a chance to watch the show .
So could you give us permission to go ?
We also can suggest how the originally programme can be changed .
We will have free time on Wednesday afternoon .
So we can do shopping instead .
Then , we could go to a show during that period
We are all looking forward to you answer .

It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Because there was a man had a serious car accident and I was walking passed him .
Nobody had noticed him because it happened at night and the car had actually crashed into the bushes .
I was thinking ' what should I do ? ' I haven't got my mobile phone at me
And I was half way between my school and home .
At that time he was unconscious , I kept asking myself ' should I woke him up or try to use my unsure first aid skills to deal with him .
I was struggling because I knew if I did n't helped him , he would die in a short time .
I decided to do something to this man , my first move was to check is there any solid or liquid which could block his breathing .
And check his body condition .
After that I turned on the car lights in order to tell the passing cars .
I ran back home for help .
I phoned to police and told the whole story .
The strangest thing happened to me , when I get back to that man .
The car and the man is not there anymore .
Where could they be ?
I was wondering .
Oh , sorry they are not on this road , they were in the next road .
Dear Madam :
I just received your letter to the good news .
I am very happy for winning the first prize of your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel in July because I have to work until the end of June .
For the accommodation I would like to have log cabins rather than tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy .
I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities .
I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs from the holiday makers .
Can you please give me some recommendations of the clothes I would need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget .
Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California .
Yours faithfully
Shopping is not always enjoyable
In my opinion shopping sometimes is really boring specially when you buy at the supermarket almost all the time the same things like cleaning products and the ingredients for every day food .
On the other hand everything looks different if I had to make a present for someone in my family .
I started thinking what she or he prefers and I try my best buys something appropriate does n't matter how much money did it cost .
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depends on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested to please .
DEAR MR ROBERTSON
I AM WRITING YOU WITH REFERENCE TO THE LONDON TRIP

WE ARE REALLY
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS SHOW .

WE WOULD PREFER TO GO THERE .
COULD YOU PLEASE BE SO KIND AND CHANGED SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT

IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM , WE SUGGESTED ON TUESDAY WENT TO THE SHOW AND ON WEDNESDAY INSTEAD FREE TIME , VISIT THE SCIENCE MUSEUM .
THOUGH
WE DONT HAVE SHOPPING AND FREE TIME .
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR ANSWER .

MIGHT 29 , 1997 .
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN LONDON .
THAT NIGHT I WENT TO A PUB IN WATERWAYS .
WHEN THEY CLOSED I TAKE THE 7 BUS .
I WAS LIVING QUITE
CLOSE OF PORTOBELLO ROAD
BUT I DIDN'T
KNOWS VERY WELL
THE AREA BECAUSE ALL TIMES I JUST HAD TO GET OFF IN THE CORNER OF MY HOUSE .
BUT THAT DAY , LIKE I WAS KIND OF DRUNK , I DIDN'T REALISES THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT WAY ; SO WHEN I NOTICED IT THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY
ASKING ME TO GET OFF , BECAUSE WE WHERE IN THE GARAGE OF PORTOBELLO .
I TOLD HIM , I DIDN'T
KNOW WHERE I AM BUT HE JUST SAID SORRY .
I WAS REALLY SCARED .
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE AROUND
BUT I AM AFRAID TO ASK
THEM
THE WAY I SHOULD TAKE .
AT LEAST I ASKED THE BOY AND HE SAID " I'LL TELL YOU WHERE IS THE PLACE
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR , JUST FOLLOW ME " .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNOW I HAVE TO DO IT .
10 MINUTES AFTER I WAS FOLLOWING HIM , I STARTED KNOWING THE PLACE , AND I WAS FELLED MORE COMFORTABLE .
HE TOOK ME
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE .
I THANK HIM SO MUCH , AND I AM SO HAPPY THAT I ASKED FOR THE RIGHT PERSON AND NOTHING WRONG HAPPENED TO ME .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in order to explain to you the problems regarding the musical show I see at your theatres .
First of all , there was written in an advertisement for the show , that there would be Danny Brook as main actor , but a different actor played in the show .
The show started forty - five minutes later and this really disappointed me .
Besides , when I bought the tickets , I found out there was not discount for tickets , while you write the contrary .
Moreover , I could not go to the theatre restaurant because , by the time the show has finished , it had already closed .
Definitely , it was a very disappointing evening
And I would appreciate your if it is possible to have my money back .
I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future .
Yours faithfully ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
She was a very pretty and kind girl , but she had this bad habits .
This was her only fault .
She has a lot of friends but nobody trusted her .
That is why she decided to change her behaviour .
She was given a chance : if she had been able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time , her friends would have started trust her .
The secret was a surprise - party at her best friend 's birthday .
As soon as the arrangement of the party started , she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her best friend .
But , as the day went on , she was surprised because she realized she was getting used not to tell secrets any more .
The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping a secret .
All her friends were amazed at her change and start trusting her for once .
Lausanne , the 20th in May 2000
Dear M. Smith ,
My name is Marie Bouchard , I came to Switzerland .
Two weeks ago , I spent a week in your fabulous city of London with my friends .
On Thursday , the 3rd in May 2000 , we went to your theatre to see "
Over the rainbow " .
Unfortunately , we are really disappointed with everything in the theatre .
Firstly , we got our tickets for your ticket office just one hour before the show .
We thought , as usual we do in London theatre , we could have discounts as it 's written in your advertisement .
Surprisingly , there are no discounts .
Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 , it 's a theatre but not a concert hall ! ! ! !
Thirdly , we were astonished by the actor whose we know of other musicals .
Why did you not change the name of your advertisement ?
In the end , the restaurant was closed because you did n't have enough staff , this evening ! !
Nothing is serious .
We really like London , the people , the night - life but this evening was really awful .
I sent you a copy of our tickets .
Would you pleased return our money back .
In advance , thank you .
I hope we are not the only people to be so upset , but it was the first and last time that I came to your theatre .
Sincerely yours
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
When her best friend , Scala , asked her an idea to surprise her husband because she is pregnant , Pat put her feet from the plate just before Scala 's husband got a surprise .
The problem is that Pat works in the Neubathin a little village .
She is a secretary in the office .
Everybody knows everybody .
Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years , their husbands too .
It was a Friday Sunday afternoon , Scala is really excited to tell her the news .
Despite she knew that Pat could n't kept secret but by this time she was confident maybe too .
Just after Scala told her the news , Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery , to tell that Scala is pregnant .
As usual , Jon , Scala 's husband came & buy the bread in the evening .
Pat 's mum was so excited about the baby , she just said " Congratulations on the new baby . "
He was so amazed and asked to repeat .
She just thought it would be a secret , she came really embarrassed .
When he went back to his house , his wife gave him a box with a shoe but it was n't a surprise !
Scala is hungry for Pat because she thinks she can keep this kind of secret .
Sir manager ,
I am writing in order to complain about what you have wrote in the advertisement in the newspaper .
I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had , I was on holiday in London and I did not have time enough to spend there , but when you say that show was the best I decided to go .
When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not available .
At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it would cost what they said .
I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous because I dislike very much the punctuality , but that is not all .
When the show started the person who was acting it was not Danny brook and he seems not to be an actor .
Really he was bad .
Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
I was let down because of your behaviour .
You want to cheat me , so I would be very pleasure if you could give my money back .
I am looking forward your answer .
Your faithfully ,
I think technology has changed my life and the way of living for almost all people around the world .
First of all technology is very useful nowadays
But really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too .
Since the creation of PCs , people - and me too , of course - are making different things .
For example we can buy food , clothes and whatever we need for internet or by telephone .
I can know what is happening in different parts of the world for a few minutes .
A very good point about this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundry and a lot of machines like microwave oven .
In my case I dislike computers .
I do n't know how to use them but
I know I have to change because they helped us to make our lives easier .
On the other hand what would happen to us in the future ?
Our lives will be managed by robots and they will replace us at our jobs .
So , what are we going to do ?
Something that I note about technology is that we are loosing green places and there are a lot of pollution , so we have to be careful .
Dear Clark ,
I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the ' international arts festival . '
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was the grateful success and I also think you choose an appropriate title for a leaflet .
However , there are some points which could be improved in the next year .
To begin with , you write down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their is only six countries involved .
My suggestion at this point is to invite more people from different countries .
Furthermore is that some concert halls are definitely in small or in other words to many people attended those concerts .
This kind of problems you could avoid when you look at big hall at the beginning .
Another point where you could improve is when you show more plays and films next year .
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea of a weekend ticket were really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attempt a whole weekend at a cheap price .
To finish this letter I would like to give you a good idea by next year .
In my opinion it would be nice if you create an exhibition places where guests can try to play different instruments .
Yours sincerely
How can you earn money in your spare time ?
I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or have already asked it .
Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it was n't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to much work .
A traditional way to earn money , for the spare time , is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village .
The problems that you have here is the weather .
For example when it is rainy , because then everything gets wet .
Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help in changing the film rolls , from cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs .
But in a case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you 're good at , I mean if you 're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people .
Of course at the beginning it was hard but you can learn a lot and if you 're good you 'll also earn some money .
Okay did n't wait , there where you 're good at and begin .
17th June 2000
Dear sir !
I am writing this letter to you , because the show " Over The Rainbow " which is the London 's newest and best musical show , is not ... to me .
Pleas apologise me , but there were many mistakes and problems with the note you have made , which disappointed me very .
I think that day Brook who is my favorite actor played in that show .
And I was really disappointed when I see Jeremy Brook on the stage .
Please , if you would be so kind and mind correct this mistake .
I would be grateful if you could correct too that show starting at 20.15 not at 19.30 .
Other thing was that there was no discounts available , and that the restaurant which I wanted to visit after the show was closed because of the main cooker sickness .
I would be very grateful if I could get my money back .
That evening which should be my perfect evening out , were in fact very tiring and boring .
Apologise me with disturbing .
I am looking forward to answer !
Best regards !
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , I knew that he was very talkative person , but it was nessesery because I wanted him to be the main director of that birthday parties for teens .
It started the week before that day .
Pat found a great place for a party called " Blue Box " .
I made a beautiful invite cards for every Agatha friends with a sign " does not tell Agatha about that , this is a surprise party for her , please keep the secret ! "
Pat arranged great DJ and drinks .
My friend and I made the perfect decoration for balloons and other party stuff .
Everyone tells us it is breath taking .
Everything is set ...
A day and hour came .
Everyone gathered in disco at 21.00 .
We are only waiting for Agatha who should come from 22 o'clock with her boyfriend .
It was so exciting ! ! !
We put off the light and then the door opened and I just heard " what the hell is going on ? !
! "
She entered the room , and everyone shouts HAPPY BIRTHDAY dear !
She was so touching that we started to cry .
Anyway the disco is great , music also .
We had fun with 5 o'clock !
Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever get !
Dear Mr / Mrs ,
I 've seen your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions for it .
I must say that International Arts Festival is really great idea .
And your last festival was very interesting too .
But also there were some notes that you should improve in the next year 's festival to make it absolutely wonderful .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there are people only in six countries .
I think it could make your festival more popular .
Jazz , rock and classical concerts are amazing , but I think that some concert halls are too small , so not everybody can come .
Your dance shows are very beautiful , art exhibitions is something original and exciting .
And also it is very interesting to talk to writers .
I think that one reasonably - priced weekend for all events is excellent idea because it is n't so Expensive as buying tickets to each event , and with this ticket you can visit everything you want .
I hope you will continue to make your festival .
Your faithfully ,
Dear Tom ,
How are you ?
Thank you for your last letter .
It is very interesting .
The question you ask me it was very original too .
I must say that rules are n't same in schools in our country .
Every school has it 's own rules .
I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students .
We are all very friendly to our class and we helped each other when we have a problem .
So the main rule in our schools is regarding teachers .
I 'm allowed to do many things at home .
My parents are very kind , and they know that their son would do everything right .
And the main reason why our family is so friendly , it 's because we haven't go many rules .
So , I think there are n't something I 'd like to change .
I hope everything is good for your family and your school .
Take care ,
13th June 2000
Dear Mrs Ryan
Regarding your letter dating from the 6th of June I 'm so happy to receive the first price .
Thanks very much .
I would like to travel from July in California .
The reason is that we have long holidays from school at this time .
Although , the accommodation is n't so important to me .
I would prefer a log cabin because of the comfort and a good bed .
I have chosen the activities surfing and photography .
I 'm a beginner in both activities .
I have some questions as follows :
1 . What kind of clothes is needed ?
2 .
What I have to pay myself ?
3 .
Should I take some money from me ?
4 .
How is the weather in California ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
A. Becker
Shopping is not always enjoyable
Most of the time was shopping fun and enjoyable .
There are a lot of reasons that could be awful to go shopping .
Even if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find .
I had once this problem .
I am looking for a special fruit .
The sales assistant at the store are n't so nice and helpful .
Sometimes they give me a bad feeling as , , customer treats in order " .
Last week I was shopping with my younger brother .
Awful .
He wants everything what his eyes saw .
All the stuff of children are at the same level as they had their eyes .
Afterwards , I felt tired and satisfied the store .
The shops have bad opening times .
When I feel me comfortable with shopping everything will be closed or you haven't enough time to look around .
My conclusion from these points is not so bad .
I like shopping at all with my best friend .
Dear Mrs Ryan !
I 'm very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
Two weeks in California in the USA is the thing I dreamed a lot .
You asked me few questions in your letter .
I would like to answer .
The only one term for me to visit you were July .
I can come to USA in July because of August I will be working with my father .
We are building a new house for our family .
What about accommodation , I prefer tents with log cabins .
Nights on hold .
July is hot .
Tents will be more coolers to sleep then the cabin .
You offer a great variety of activities .
My best sports disciplines are swimming and basketball .
I am a life guard and I could work in your camp as a rescuer next summer .
Basketball is the game which I love .
I always watch an NBA match on T.V. It would be great for me to train basketball in USA .
I have questions .
How much money should I take with me and what sort of clothes being requested
Thank You .
Yours sincerely K.
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
Ten or fifteen years ago we had in Poland empty shelves in shops .
We could only buy things in Russia .
People always queued to stuff in west .
If you had wanted something special for example a gift you have to stay in a line all night .
It was the worst side of shopping in Poland couple years ago .
Nowadays we have capitalism , free market lots of private shops , markets and super - markets .
We can buy everything what we imagined .
Polish super market was not Polish origin shops .
They were imported from other Western Europe countries .
I appreciate this shopping for lots of products , cheep prices end big spaces .
But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing , for example bread .
On Freddy evening and about on a weekday each supermarkets are crowded .
They were filled with people who go buy everything .
I do not like crowded places .
This is the reason why I do not like shopping .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I am writing to reply to your letter in which you communicate I have won first prize in your competition .
I am glad .
Thank you very much .
Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know further information on travel and accommodation .
I would like to travel in July because in June I was going to take some exams at university and at the moment I do not know the exact date .
I can tell you I was only freed in July .
I would prefer an accommodation in log cabins because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
As regards as a chance to do two activities while I am in the camp I would like to practise painting and photography .
I am a painter in oils on life and my subjects are landscapes , people , animals .
I like also taking photographs , for example during my journey or trips .
So when I went back home I can use my best picture to reproduce them as a painting .
Would you give me some information about clothes to wear there ?
I would like also to know how much money I could bring .
Looking forward to hearing from you
Yours sincerely ,
Billy Esposito
There is somebody who says that ' shopping is not always enjoyable ' and who is happy only when can go shopping .
In the first I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do so in a hurry or on duty .
If you have to run from one shop to another and always looks at the watch , do shopping is a terrible activity .
On the other hand if you can walk without anytime problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable .
For instance , it is funny enter a clothes shop and try for a skirt or a t - shirt although you do not buy anything .
To sum up I enjoy wasting money and buy useful thing or not .
I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing above all on Saturdays when you have finished the work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
DEAR MS .
RYAN ,
IN REFERENCE TO YOUR LETTER DATED 28 MAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INFORMING ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION RESULTS .
I AM VERY GLAD
TO HEAR THAT I WAS THE WINNER OF A COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY
LAST MONTH .
IT IS VERY PLEASED TO KNOW
THAT I HAVE A CHANCE
TO SPEND TWO WEEKS IN CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA , WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE .
ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME , ACCOMMODATION 'S PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO .
ANSWER
THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY .
THE REASON IS I AM WORKING AT THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES AS
A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND
WE ARE PREPARED TO
THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER .
WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS WHOLE AUGUST
SO THE
ONLY ONE VACATION MONTHS I CAN GO IS JULY .
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER
THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME
I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP , PREPARING
SOME FINANCIAL REPORTING SO THE ELECTRICITY WOULD BE NEEDED .
I THINK THAT
THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE
AT ALL .
REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY .
I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS THAT
IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS .
PHOTOGRAPHY ARE MY HOBBY .
SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE .
PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING ( ESPECIALLY IN POLAND , WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPEN )
LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS OF HUGE
SUPERMARKETS AND MEN
ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW IN THEIR CARS , MOTOR OR COMPUTERS .
PEOPLE ALL OVER
THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILIES ( IT 'S EASY TO CHOOSE
REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM , TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER , LUNCH OR BREAKFAST ) .
BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL .
THE REASONS ARE ; DISTANCE , LACK OF CARING , CROWDED STREETS , TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP .
THEY CAN SAY , , SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE '' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD FOR CATALOGUES OR IN
THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON A CORNER .
THEY ARE TOO LAZY TO WALK AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR BIRTHDAY
PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRLS - FRIENDS .
ON THE OTHER HAND - IT 'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SEAT
AT HOME , CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDERS REALISATION .
PEOPLE , WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPS HAD THEIR OWN REASONS FOR THIS SITUATION
( MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP - ASSISTANCE , BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE , HAD BAD EXPERIENCES WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS ) .
THEY DON'T LIKE
SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER ( SOMETIMES IT 'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE ) .
ANYHOW EVERYBODY SHOULD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT , NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE .
EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS
( AND SPEND MONEY ) .
BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE A WAY HOW TO DO IT .
IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON A LIFE - STYLE , PERSONALITY AND NEEDS .
Dear Helen ,
Thank you very much for your recent letter .
I could not believe that I won the first prize ( It 's great ! )
And of course , I am very happy .
As your question , I am free to travel only in July because I will have my holiday after finishing the exams .
And , I have returned from my university in August .
I prefer to stay in log cabin rather than in tents because I am not used to with narrow spaces and feel more comfortable in a place like bedroom .
Furthermore , I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobby and my fascinating in art and enjoyed to take a photograph of wildlife .
Finally , please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring ?
And how much would be spent there .
Also , please advice for any necessary things to prepare and bring .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
Sorry I haven't wrote to you for such a long time , but I 've got a good excuse !
Last month , I was partly on the concert team .
It was a big one that I never thought and I could n't imagine how amazing is it .
I did n't know what is my responsible until they called me to train .
What a surprised !
And unbelievable , I was responsible for looking after the pop star .
You may understand how excited I was .
But , I 've gotten though it .
I have to take care of them during a break , serving the drink , clothes , even brought them some cigarettes and anything they want .
I think they are so hospitality and warm to people around them .
You know !
Because of these are changing all my opinions about self - important behavior of superstars .
The most appreciated is they 've given me their latest CD with signatures .
Marvellous thing !
And of course as you have seen it I 've given one for you .
I hope you 're well and enjoyed a CD and do n't forgot to write back all of your news during my summer holiday job .
Love ,
Dear Mr. Ryan ,
I received your letter and I am very glad I have won a two week travel to Camp California .
I will give you some information which helps you to know me better .
I would like to travel to camps in July because this is the best time for me and I hope for you .
I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my travels .
About accommodation , I think tents would be great .
Basketball and swimming I think is the best for the children .
Basketball would help children to build team character and leadership .
And swimming is very good for health .
I swim really good and I am a professional basketball player .
I count on my experiences .
And there are few questions I would like to ask .
First , what clothes should I take with me , secondly .
How much money and by cash or by travel cards .
Thanks !
I am looking forward to our meeting .
Yours sincerely ,
Vasiliy Alekseyev .
Dear Kim ,
Last month I enjoy helping to concerts of " Modern talking ''
And now I want to share with you my experience .
It all started when one of the organizers asked me to help him with a concert of my favorite band .
And what do you think I answer ?
Of course , yes !
I have gotten very responsible work I had to bring food with Peter Bowen and Tomas Sanders .
Can you imagine ?
I came into their room and give hot Cheeseburgers , Coca - Cola and ice - cream to Peter .
It was the happiest moment of my life .
He asked me was a cheeseburger hot and I answered that it was .
I was very nervous talking about him .
He told me on concert programmes and gave me his photo of the sign .
I will never forget that summer day .
It is my day , I am sure of it .
Well , I think that is all .
See you .
Yours faithfully ,
Vasiliy .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to you on the show .
I was very disappointed after this show .
I would like to have my money back .
At first the show started at 10.15 , and it should be at 19.30 .
After your show I wanted to visit my friend , and because of it , I did n't do it .
Also , you write about discounts , but it 's not true !
The woman , who sold the ticket was very proud of me , actually she started swearing at me .
During the show , I was very hungry but I hoped to visit restaurants , it 's a pity , but restaurant was closed because it was too late .
And , I forgot to say about actors , I did n't enjoy them .
So , I hope I will get my money back , it was very disappointing evening out of my life !
I hope you understand me !
Your sincerely
Angelina
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , but any way I trusted him .
It 's happened 3 months ago , and during this month I am very upset .
I have a friend , his name Peter , he was my best friend .
One day Peter killed one boy .
They were just playing and is accident , Peter shot him .
I was there , I saw it .
I hoped that it , just could see 3 people , but it was mistake ...
Pat saw it !
We spoke with Pat many times to keep this secret , not to tell anyone .
We trusted him .
At first several days , Pat all the time are with us .
He promised to keep secret , for the next morning we had arguments with Pat , 3 of us were shouting at each other , with shorter Pat went away from us .
Two days later in the morning , a policeman came to Peter ...
So , now my best friend were prisoners .
All the time I was thinking about Peter .
I do n't forget him .
He will be in the prison 5 years .
By the way I do n't see Pat in one year .
Perhaps , he moved into another town .
It 's good that
He far away ...
I miss Peter very much , it 's unfair to put him in prison .
But it 's life , destiny , very cruel destiny ...
Dear Ms Ryan ,
I am writing to you regarding the letters you sent me , in the two weeks at Camp California that I won .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off at the beginning of the month .
For accommodation , I would prefer to tents because I like adventure and simplicity .
Concerning the available activities , firstly , I would choose climbing because I have practised it for many years .
Secondly , I am interested in discovering something that I had never done , so I would like to do sailing .
Finally , I was wondering if some special clothes are required and how much pocket money I need on this trip ?
I thank you for advanced and look forward to your reply .
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim ,
I 'm writing to you to relate my experience in helping at a pop concert last month .
First of all , I would like to tell you that I 've never had such good times in my life !
The day one consisting of surrounding the festival 's place with fences .
The second day objective was to install the scene , with lights , loudspeakers and all stuff .
This job was quite hard , but we took enough time to be not exhausted !
The last day , in fact the concert days are absolutely fantastic .
The public was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncer front of the scene , to avoid the people coming to the concert floor .
Finally , the concert was exactly that the people were expected .
I hoped that the next time you will come to me !
I 'm looking forward to hearing your impressions of this !
See you soon .
Dear Mr ,
I was a foreign student who is on holiday here .
I am going to stay here a week .
I went to your theatre three days ago and it was horrible .
I 'm sorry but I was very disappointing for the musical show .
I would like to explain you my experience because I want you to give my money back .
The last Monday , I go to the theatre with two friends .
We arrived on time but a musical show was delayed until half - passed eight .
Moreover , we have n't any discounts for art students .
On the other hand , the main actor was changed to another and nobody told us .
When there is a restful we went to a restaurant which was closed because it was late .
We could n't having a drink .
Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give my money back because of the advertisement there are some things that we had n't in the theatre .
Finally , it would be grateful if you could answer me soon .
Yous insincere ,
Our lives are changing .
When I was a child I had different entertainment that actually children had n't .
We could play with our toys , dolls and we could enjoy without a computer .
We have n't so many machines than they have .
The technology is growing and growing .
If you have a computer you will be able to have all the information that you want .
It 's very important but some times it is the wrong thing because the children can see it too .
Moreover you can change the TV programmes without getting up .
We can find information about the weather , sports on our TV - text .
On the other hand , the science is changing .
We have more researchers than some years ago and we will be able to find a solution for lots of problems .
Actually , we can cure illness which is very dangerous before .
I 'm sure that in a couple of years we will see cure some illnesses like cancer , UT .
The new technology is changing our lives .
Dear Madam ,
I 'm writing to You in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival .
I spent two days there , and I thought it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been in .
I also hope , that the festival could be even better next year .
The great idea about making it " international " is unfortunately not brought to life , because the artists ( mentioned to be " from around the world " )
Were in only six countries .
Maybe the reason for that is very simple : lack of money ?
It would explain , why some concert halls were simply too small - you just could n't afford bigger ones .
On the other hand , the wide range of plays and films to choose impressed me most .
I thank you for organizing it , and hope to see more next year .
I also thank you for an excellent idea for one ticket to all events , which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in .
My suggestion for next year 's festival is simple - please make it a few days longer !
Yours faithfully ,
Dear friends ,
Thank you for your last letter -
I am very pleased to receive it .
If you really want to hear about school rules for my country , I 'll try to write about them in a nutshell .
We do not have many school rules , and the teachers are rather liberal .
We do n't have to wear any special uniforms for signs of our schools .
Some rules are really simple : we must be in school on time , and we must not disturb others during the class .
We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course !
In winter we are to change our shoes .
It may sound funny , but mud , gravel and snow lay on the school 's floor
Is not a nice sight , so we changed our shoes without questioning that rules .
I was also used to write exams which are to polish school very often .
At home I do n't has many rules either .
I must wash the dishes from time to time ( I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty ) and cleaned our house .
I do n't thought there was anything I 'd like to change .
I 'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with yours !
Your faithfully ,
Dear Ms Helen Ryan
I write to find out further information and give you some details about myself and the travel that I had won in your competition .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I am able to travel only in July .
Because , I was a student and in June , I would still have schools .
Also , in August I will be studying the summer English courses .
In addition , I would prefer to stay in a tent .
Because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and every day comfort , in these two weeks .
However , in your letter was written some activities .
I would choose basketball and tennis .
Basketball I had been playing in a team , in my town for ten years .
Also tennis is my favourite hobby and I played twice every week with my friends .
Finally , I would be grateful to you , if you tell me about clothes and money .
Will we need any special clothes and how much you would suggest me to carry on these two weeks ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim
How are you ?
I am very well I 'm writing to explain my experience with the pop concert ; last month .
First of all , I think that I helped them .
Every day of that month I was trying to advertise this concert .
I am going to market in school and I was given information when and where the group was going to appear as well as where can they buy or booking a ticket for this concert .
I know , It was difficult and tired but I enjoyed a lot .
Firstly , it was a good break from the routine .
Because I did it for first time .
Also , I felt wonderful when I saw , that the concert had success and every day was crowded .
Because I believe that this was a result which came with my help .
I would like to do again it in the future .
It was a fantastic experience .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Best wishes
Dear Mr Robertson ,
I 'm writing to you to thank you for the programme you have organised .
All students are very pleased and we are looking forward to going to London .
We know we are going for three days , but we 'll have enough time to use one of the big cities in the world .
London is the place to be when always something happening .
We all very happy with your programming , especially we like the idea of sightseeing in our and National Art Gallery .
The students in my class have seen an advertisement in the London fashion and Leisure Show , we would like to ask you if was possible to make some changes to the programme ?
The show is on Tuesday the 14th between 10.00- 13.00 .
We think is a great opportunity to see latest fashion , found to make up and hairstyles .
And all of it is free ,
According to your programme we have the science museum which is in the morning and then shopping .
Would it be possible to go to the museum and then for the shopping in our free time which is on Wednesday ?
All students will be very grateful .
Your sincere
I think all of us home is something which is very important .
Home sweet home .
We call home the places where we live or the country where we come from .
Anyway home is always a place to go because is ours we feel save and comfortable .
Home sweet home .
After hard work we wanted to go home to have our corners where we are all able to rest and relax .
I think in the future home may be just the place to go to sleep .
We live in a very busy world !
Working long hours , doing plenty of activities , go out , go on holiday .
We even did n't spending time with family .
Probably in the future we might be to busy to go in our own homes and spend some time there .
But at the end of the day it always would be placed to go !
We found our family there and our lives .
Some of us have been living in one house since they were born .
We are sentimental and we have memories of the past .
I think it 's a part of our life.lf
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to complain about a musical show .
Over the Rainbow , which you advertise .
I saw the show at your theatres with my friend in 6th June .
However , I was disappointed with something which did not match your advertisement .
First of all , I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his play .
He did not play in the evening .
It makes me sad .
Secondly , the starting time has been changed to 19:30 20:15 .
We wait for ages because we have not been informed .
In addition , although you advertise the discounted tickets available , they do not sale them any more according to your staff .
Finally , we went to a restaurant in your theater after the show .
It is closed because of staff training .
I am sure you can understand my disappointment .
I must insist that you refunded the cost of the show .
Unless I hear from you within ten days , I shall have to take legal advice on the matter .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
Yours faithfully ,
It is believed that our life style has been changed by modern technology such as computers and washing machine etc .
Especially for families .
I have found very expensive to buy them but there are number of advantages .
First of all , dishwashers are very efficient at me because I work full time and look after my children .
It is very difficult to cook and wash dishes after work .
Before buying my dishwasher I asked my son to wash them .
He complained a lot .
Secondly , computers are useful for us as well , because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to have information , for example travel .
However my family 's members do less communicate with each other than we used to , because my children are keen on playing computer games .
In my opinion , the modern technology makes our life style combinient .
It is very good for us but I think we should think more carefully when we buy something for our children .
Dear Sir ,
I would like to complain about the show which you presented with last Saturday .
It was such disappointing evening out with my friend during our week 's holiday in London .
We have had a quite pleasant time except the evening .
Actually it spoil our time .
So I would like to get back our money .
These are some points I want mentioned on the difference between the advertisement said and the reality .
First , I have a great expectation to see Danny Brook plays his role , but he had never shown up that night .
The main actor was an unknown actor .
It was a such disappointing .
Second , it started only in 20:15 .
It was 45 minutes later than it suppose to be .
It was a such soaring to wait the show at a noisy and hot theatre .
Third , there is no possibility of discounting .
The girl sold the tickets were laughing at me when I mention the discounts availability was wrote in the advertisement .
Forth , the theatre restaurant was closed .
There is not on the door saying that the painting was going at the weekend .
How could you arrange work like that ?
Finally the sentence was written blew down on the advertisement is absolutely not true .
It was most imperfect evening out I ever experienced .
I wish that you can provide a good service next time , and this time you need give back the money we paid .
Sincerely
Yu PhD Hung .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time to make intimate friendship with people around me .
First it was because of a culture difference .
It took quite long time to adjust to the multi culture in a language institute .
Secondly the language ability is another issue .
Even I could meet some friends , but I could n't express my heat to them for we have different back ground and our first language is different .
I really wish to have a friend can share everything is going in our lives .
Finally I meet Pat .
She was a such wonderful people in our class .
She tried to help others when they have difficult time at school .
One day she realized that I was always being outside in circles .
One day she invited me to her flat .
Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together at weekends usually .
We had a fantastic time together in three months .
Even we could make the trip to Paris for the school holidays !
We have many common interests in music , art and books .
I think that I found a good friend in my life .
So I told her everything about my life .
There were some stories I never told anyone before , but I had shared with her all my secrets .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Few days later I tell her about my secret love story , it became the top gossip among my classmates .
It was a nightmare !
Dear sir / madam ,
Thank you for your letter and your congratulations .
I never thought that I would win the competition .
It is really wonderful .
I can stay at Camp California in the U.S.A. in two weeks .
I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June , so I can only travel in July .
I wonder if it is all right for that time .
And in my accommodation .
I prefer living in a log cabin , because it was more comfortable .
I like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere when I lived in .
I like to do some activities in water and my favourite activity is swimming .
Before I came England , I swam every weekend in my country even in winter , so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am in the camp .
Actually , my mind had already gone there , I ca n't wait even for a minute .
I wanted to go there now .
By the way , I would like to know the shopping especially for clothes , I wanted to buy some for myself .
And do you think I need to exchange money before I go there ?
I look forward to your letter .
Yours faithfully ,

Subject : about daily life at our schools
Introduction
This report is aimed to research the students about their daily life at school and give some suggestion of it .
What do students do now ?
Lots of students normally have classes in the morning .
And sometimes they do something in the library of themselves in the afternoon .
For instance , reading , looking at some information or using computers .
What do they think about it ?
The arts students want to learn another foreign language .
Moreover , some foreign students hoping there will be some English classes that aim for an examination .
Most of them want to do more activity in the afternoon .
Recommendations
Open some foreign language classes in part - time for the students who are interested in it .
Let foreign students do more excises on English to help them pass the exam .
Using the equipment and area what we have to organise some activities .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I 'm writing to complain about my horrible evening at the Circle Theatre on 10th June 2000 .
Last week I was on holiday in London and I go to the theatre for entertaining but
I wish I 'd not gone there because everything went wrong .
I bought a ticket at the box office but there were not any discounts for students like you said in the advertisement for the show and also the show had to start at 19.30 but on that day
It delayed for 45 minutes .
During the show I was expected to meet Danny Brook who is my favourite actor and Tina Truelove .
There are Robert Alan and Jack Ruby instead of them .
It really disappointed me .
After finishing the show I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed .
It was a sign in front of the restaurant " sorry we closed because special reasons " and I was wondering what are the reasons for that .
Finally I would like to have refunds for my ticket back because it was horrible evening .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Pay NutraSweet ( missing )
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets that why our great plan for holiday is not being real .
It happened in last summer we plan to go on holiday in the southern part of Thailand by motorbike but we could n't tell our parents because they would n't allow us to go .
We started our journey and we arrived at our purpose place from 6 o'clock in the evening .
The sun is shining and winds were breeze like we had images .
While I was standing on a beach
Suddenly I heard someone call my name and said that I had to go home , thats right , she is my mum .
She told me Pat had phoned her while we were gone and my mum followed us because it is so dangerous to went by bicycle .
Even through we could spend our holidays there but with my mum and I just found that it was fantasy time which I had never though about it .
From now on I do n't want to tell something secret to Pat because she always tell someone else
But she still my best friend .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I am writing to thank you for your letter confirming the first prize that I won in your competition .
I would like also to the present to give you some information about me in order to arrange the details of the trip .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only during July because in June I was going to give examinations for the first certificate in English .
Furthermore , in August I will be preparing for my course at the university which I am starting next September .
Secondly , I would be grateful if you could arrange for me accommodation in log cabins as I am not used to living in the countryside and especially in tents .
In addition , I would like to inform you that I prefer to do surfing and sailing while I will be at the camp , as I am an active member of sailing and Surfing Club in Manchester and it will be a great chance for me to practise my techniques and skills .
I would be also grateful if you could send me information about the average living costs in California as I have to arrange the amount of money that I was going to spend , and some advice about the clothes that I need .
I would like also to specify if the food is included in the prize .
Please let me know if you need more information .
Yours sincerely
As requested , I visited some classes during a lesson and some other rooms while activities were taking place .
The aim of this report is making a series of suggestions from which lessons and other activities should be filmed .
It 's seems to me that it will be an extremely good advertisement for our school if you take plans from the lesson of Chemistry in the laboratory , because our laboratory is new , recognised as one of the best in the area as it has a huge amount of instruments and really some very good professors , and also many experiments are taking place in this laboratory
Furthermore , I think it would be a good idea to take plans for a match in our school team on the football field as it was completely new and full quipped .
In addition , I think you have to take also plans to the school 's nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children , and the parents can recognise that the teachers are very good .
I think also that would be a good idea to take some general plans for the school area as there is a huge background .
In conclusion , I have to declare that my myself and my fellow students will be available to help with this short video by all means .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I was delightful to receive your letter saying that I had won the two - weeks holiday for your recent competition and it will all pay in advance .
I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you organize all the necessary details of a forthcoming holiday .
I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July , due to the problems beyond my control .
Otherwise I would not be able to travel abroad .
I would rather stay in one of the log cabin as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid contacting them .
It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp .
As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in them .
I came second last year 's swimming competition and I had enrolled photography class .
In the camp I can practise them aloft .
I was wondering if I need to bring some extra money and thick clothes with me in case there is an emergency .
Could you please let me know as soon as you receive my letter .
Yours faithfully
Dear Kim ,
I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another .
But I finally got around writing and you 'll see that it 's definitely worth waiting as I have some great and unbelievable news to tell you .
As you know I 'm a half - term school holidays and have plenty of time to do much more different things apart from studying my A - level history , such as meeting up my friends , visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own .
However this term has been a far cry from the other .
You will see why I 'm describing it as the most forgettable one when you read through my letter .
Couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend who is into music and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing .
She invited me to a rehearsal at a huge concert whose singer was a well - known pop stars as well as my favorite .
Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs some of which I put in an envelope .
It is like a dream come true , and are the best part of the experience in my opinion .
I help out my friend from writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments .
Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it is one of the days I will never forget throughout my life
Wrote me soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear sir / madam
I am writing with regard to your advertising .
During my 2 week 's holiday I would like to attend a musical show .
It was my favorite plays .
I am very hopeful that I was going to have a good time .
But there are many things which went wrong .
Firstly , I have had no discount for paying .
Secondly there are delays which get me into trouble ,
After the show I could n't catch my train .
Because I do n't have any plan I decided to have a lunch of theatre restaurant .
But it was closed .
The worst thing is that I could n't watch my favorite actor .
I was so disappointing for that .
I could n't concentration on the play any more .
Contrary to the advertising everything was disappointing .
I regret to demand all my expenses .
I hope you are going to be taken into consideration my terrible situation .
I am waiting for a satisfactory answer
Yours faithfully

Technology has developed increasingly in recent years .
As a result of this our society has changed a lot .
On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easy .
On the other hand we have faced some problems , such as social and environmental problems .
Nowadays students have much more facilities for education than before .
Although in those days the only way of learning is reading .
These days we can use computer , television and some sophisticated equipment .
Which is unusually before .
Than of technology we can reach any place in the world easily .
We can get some information more quickly .
Technology has a huge effect on our spare time activity as well .
Children play wit computers instead of usual plays .
Despite the huge facility technology has affected our lives negatively .
There have been changing relationships between people .
People are getting more and more lonely .
We have noticed the environmental damage in recent years .
While we are using technology , we should take into consideration environment .
We should n't allowed to be exploited the world .
If we want to leave a good world to the next generation , we should behave more respectfully against nature .
Dear Mr. Clark ,
I 'm an Italian student who has come to the last International Arts Festival .
I think this festival is a great idea because it 's a possibility to see and to love the arts , but , I think also there are some things that could be changed .
I noticed that the artists were in only six countries instead that from around the world .
This choice does n't gave many artists the possibility to express themselves .
Some concert hall is too small and often people could n't see the performances .
There are many events that I think there are a few plays and films .
Maybe it would be better put more of them in the programme because they like so much with young people .
The very young people , the choice to offer a reasonably - priced weekend ticket is an excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact at all what it art .
I hope that my opinion can help you to set fro the next year a great international arts festival alone with young people .
Thank you and greeting .
I think a good way to get money it 's work in a fast - food .
Maybe the first impression is n't positive but from my personal experience , I can say that this kind of job is right to get some money .
For six months I 've worked at a McDonald 's restaurant in Italy and I 've got lots of money .
I work eight hours every day but with every fast - food you could work part - time , four , three , six hours every day .
It depends on what you need .
This kind of job is perfect for the young people who want get money and in the meantime they have to study .
If you work in a fast - food you can work in the afternoon , or during the night and so you have time for yourself .
In the staff you can also find young people and get fun with them during the work .
What do you want more ?
If you need money and you need time to yourself trying a job like that .
Dear Mr. Robertson ,
The trip that you plan on us , students , it 's a great chance to meet new people and visited a beautiful city like London .
Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer to the students the best way to spend our time without wasting time in silly places or events .
We 'd like to thank you because the kind of happening shows how you are dedicated to our school and the students that studying there .
It 's great to visit especially the Science Museum because of its exposition .
But there is something that I 'd like to ask .
The London fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be exposition of the latest fashions , with a new hairstyle , with the new leisure and sports clothes and people teach how to make up .
Our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon .
By this way , the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London fashion .
Thanks for the attention and we are waiting for your answer .
Yours faithfully ,
Famous people x media
Famous people are special for the rest of the society .
They form opinions and invent new fashion style .
Nowadays , the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information .
The media are starting to get into the private lives of these famous people .
It 's important to respect other people lives because it can cause serious problems for the family of the person or in his life .
If a famous person does n't mind by being filmed in his personal life there is no problem .
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacy the media has to respect .
Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer .
In summary , the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like familiar problems or personal problems .
The respect is essential .
They deserve to have a private life like any common people .
Dear Mr / Mss
I 'm writing you to complain about musical show , that I had visited last evening .
I had a week holiday in London , so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure , however it was a bad evening of my life .
First of all , the actors are different from those who are advertised .
Second , the show started with 20:15 , although
I read that it started with 19:30 !
More over after watching a show I want to visit your theatre restaurant , but it was closed , it really disappointed me .
It was my dream to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , so it is still my dream because of your show .
So , I have no perfect evening out and I want my money back .
I hope you 'll understand my situation and if you want other people to visit your show , you should return my money .
Yours faithfully
How has modern technology changing my daily life .
Fifty years ago people even did n't think that after 2000 years they would have another life .
When Thomas Edison invented the electric light , it is the greatest invention of people of that century .
And nowadays modern technology can change all our lives .
I mean , almost everyone has now a car , a computer , a mobile phone and even an airplane .
My life is changing too .
First of all now I can phone my friends and parents from every place , I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the internet .
Second modern technology helps me in the kitchen .
Cooking became faster with the help of a microwave .
What is more modern technology prevents different illnesses .
Further more , yesterday I 've heard that every man could fly to the space without any experience , it is great , from my point of view in 2050 years everybody will fly to the space .
On the other hand people can atrophied in all this invention .
He became lazy because they know that they can seat on the sofa and turn the chances of the TV by pressing a boon .
In conclusion I want to say that in spite of this , I hope that in future we will have more and more new inventions and they will stop our disasters and problems .
Dear Mr Robertson
First of all I would like to thank you for the good programmes you organised for our trip to London .
Especially a sightseeing bus seemed to be very interesting .
But we would like to suggest you something : There is a trendy event for the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear ; make up and hairstyles of the 14th of March .
It is called , , a London fashion and Leisure Show .
" This would be a great opportunity because we are all interested in clothes , sports and fashion .
I have almost forgot to mention that it is free to students !
Unfortunately we realise that in the 14th we would already visit the Science Museum .
The show lasts nine hours , at 10.00 - 19.00 , a whole day !
Our question now : could we go on this show ?
We could maybe change Tuesday 's programme on Wednesday .
We all prefer the show , free time is not so important to us .
Please think about this and give us an answer .
Thanks .
Yours faithfully
Dear Jack
Thanks a lot for your letter .
I was fine but quite busy because I have my German exams .
Therefore I reading Agatha Christie 's , , Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " .
I can really recommend you this book , it is fabulous .
It is also a suitable presents for your cousin , I think .
One story is about ten people who stay together at a hotel on a lonely island .
There is a storm and they could not leave .
Suddenly the murderer happens !
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
There are also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective and he finally solved the mystery .
But I will not tell you more .
You have to read it yourself .
And if your cousin like crime stories it is the perfect book !
Unfortunately it is quite expensive , £ 32 .
But do not worry about the price because your cousin would love it !
Okay , I hope to have news for you very soon .
Have a good time .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Sir / Madam :
Thank you for telling me that I had won the first prize and now I am writing to tell you the information you have requested .
First of all , I think I would like to travel in July , which will be the only months for me to go .
Because my course wo n't finish until the end of June , and I will have to stay in college to get ready for the new term .
Then I 'd like to choose the tents in my accommodation when at Camp California .
I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others .
However , during my stay at camp , there are two activities I can choose , one of them I will choose basketball because it is the sport I play most , I and my friends used to win the first place in school - wide match when we were in school .
And the other one , I think paintings would be a good idea ; painting is one of my hobby and I 've been learning it since I was 5 years old and now I 'm still doing it once I have free time .
Above are all the information you asked , however , here is something I 'd like to know ; first is about the clothes , what kind of clothes I need to take in ?
And another question is what is the price of things like in there , so that I can make a better budget for my trip .
Look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim :
Thanks for your last letter
; I knew you would interested in my experience in helping the pop concert last time , now I tell you about it .
The place we worked was a football pitch ; we spent 3 days of setting up the stage , the equipment , and the lights .
In fact , there is nothing very important I did , because we are not the right people to do it .
I only put the speakers in the right places , or helping engineers tested the lights .
But with the brakes and after work , I had a chance to talk to the engineers , and I learned something about setting up the equipment .
The fourth day , the singer and the players have been there to test .
Then I had a chance to speak to them .
From that , I learned more about instruments .
Finally , the date of cancer coming .
After the concert finished successfully , I was happier than ever because the succeed influenced my work and that was the most enjoyable moments in my life .
Anyway , now I have to stop to finish my homework .
I 'm looking forward to receive your letter again .
Best wishes .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 'm writing to complain about the musical show named OVER THE RAINBOW .
Regarding your advertisement , it is the LONDON 'S NEWEST and best musical show , but I am deeply disappointed by it .
According to your advertisement , the earrings were DANNY brooks and TINA truelove .
I decided to go to see this show because of its startling , but on the day I saw it , a different actor played .
He was not DANNY brook .
Moreover there is no discount tickets .
They are all sold out .
You should have said they were very few .
I had to buy a £ 20 ticket .
To make matters worse , the time that the show started being delayed .
It started with 20:15 , forty five minutes later !
That 's why I could n't having a dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show .
It has already closed , when the show finished .
I 'd like to ask for a full refund from this awful night .
Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible .
Yours faithfully
Modern technology has changed my life .
Especially , the computer has made my daily life changed dramatically .
It was only two or three years since I have used a computer at home , but now I wonder how I can live without it .
I open my e - mail box every night .
When I found a new message , I 'm very happy .
Before using e - mail , I used to write letters and sometimes telephone .
However I 've found e - mail is better than them .
Because as soon as I sent my message , they can receive it .
In other words , I can also receive their reply soon .
It 's really useful , when I need quick replies .
Moreover when I send e - mail , I need not worry about the timing .
I can send them anytime I like .
Thanks to modern technology , I enjoy chatting with my friends in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to complain about the show , "
Over the Rainbow " which I saw on your theatres last week .
I was really disappointed because the show is far from what I expected .
First of all , I was really expecting to see Danny Brook , my favourite actor .
However , he was not on the stage that day .
Secondly the show started late
And I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything .
It is a waste of time .
I also think that there should have been discounts for students , which in fact was not available and I had to pay for normal price .
Further more , the restaurant at the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay .
I have to go home without eating a dinner , though I was really hungry .
I have to say that the evening was terrible .
If I had known all about them , I would have changed my plans and could have a good time .
I strongly suggest you should give us right information .
I also would like to claim some refunds for the evening .
I hope this matter will receive your prompt attention .
Yours faithfully ,
Fashion for 100 years
If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago , you 'll notice that there are incredibly big differences between them .
People have become more informal , casual and practical than before .
But how about the fashion of the future , for example , 100 years from now ?
I think it 'll also be very different now .
But in which ways ?
First of all , people might think more about the function of clothing than the design .
For example , they 'll wear a cloth which protect themselves from air pollution , sunshine etc .
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouths and noses like we have sun - glasses , and that all the masks are designer brands , which are made of special material to prevent us from breathing polluted air .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scared .
Imagine that all the people have hats with big edges to protect their faces in sun - burned , and it 's the most trendy fashion of the year !
It 's funny .
But we never know ! !
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I recently had a holiday in London and had been to your musical show ' Over the Rainbow ' but found it very disappointing .
It is said that the singers were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement .
However , there is a different unknown actors in that .
The show started later at 20:15 which is very different from ' 19.30 ' as shown .
There is no discount at all which is in contrast to ' Discounts Available ' .
After the show , I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason .
The real show it owns is really very different from what is mentioned in an advertisement .
I was unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back .
Please would you also changed the advertisement on the level of the actual facts .
Thank you for your attention .
Yours faithfully ,
What will clothes were like 100 years from now ?
It is a very hard thing to predict .
The fashion for nowadays clothing is just keeps on changing .
Although some may appears again after few years different styles are developed .
For the fashion of the future , I think it depends on the people 's own personality and develop their own styles which suits them the most .
They can wear different kinds of clothing , like they designed for themselves or those like history can wear those in Victorian times and in different countries .
For the colour , I think the metallic colours , especially silver , will be the most popular .
As different kinds of fabrics will be invented & the clothing will never be just cotton as always been seen .
Maybe paper could also be the fabric used to make clothing and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday .
They can be thrown away after wearing it and light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change your wearing .
Dear Mrs. Ryan .
I 'm glad to receive your letter .
I 'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize .
It would be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
First of all , I would like to say that the only month available for me to travel is July .
I finished my class on the 25th of June and August is for going with my parents in France .
This has been scheduled 3 months ago .
About accommodation , I would prefer the log cabin because I think they are more cleaner than the tents .
While I 'm staying there I would like to practise tennis and basketball , as I have been playing both sports all my life , and I have to say that I am very good at both .
There is one question I would like to ask you about the camp .
I would like to know if there are any washing machine or a place to wash our clothes .
I hope this letter containing all the information you need from me .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
From my point of view , the real question is : Who says that is enjoyable ?
Maybe in women , but not for me .
I know that this sounds horrible , but sometimes it 's what really happened .
For men , sometimes is hard to go shopping with their partners .
Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town .
And of course , we are not allowed to stop in the places that we like .
The Sports shop .
You can not lose time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive .
And that is always what we want .
That 's men 's intentions .
Another point is to go a big area .
Specially weeks - ends .
Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around .
People should have to take a license to drive those things .
Someone could be injured .
And of course , the time to pay .
A huge hue that lasted half an hour or more and finish with you completely freaked out .
In conclusion , for me to go shopping was not enjoyable at all .
Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing to you inform you about a disappointing evening I had when I went to your heather to see a play called " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
According to the advertisement you give , there have been some important differences .
Firstly , the play started almost an hour late , and I went there to see Danny Brook , but there was a different actors on stage .
Secondly , in an advertisement the discounts are available but on the ticket I bought they were no discount .
Furthermore , I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work in were on holiday .
In addition to this , I have to tell you that it is the most horrible evening I had out and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refounding of a part of the money I waste there .
I would be grateful if you do it .
Finally , I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your heather to cheat on your customers .
If you do it , there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them .
I look forward to hearing from you
Your sincerely ,
How has modern technology changing my daily life ?
Nowadays , technology is the most useful tool that human beings have .
It affects everyone who lived on this planet and every activity makes of it .
In this case we are going to focus on me .
Emilio Almodar , 18 years old , University Student , and the career I had chosen was International Commerce or markets .
I use technology every moment but I did not realise .
For example , when I come back home from university and I called my friends , I am using it because at home we have very modern phone and fax and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and things like that .
We also have five computers , the latest versions of them , because they are useful for my father to work and for me to do some special work for universities .
This machines are connected to Internet , and it gave to my family too much facility to get every information we want , how to prepare son drink to what was the result of Sunday 's football match .
In addition to this we use the net to communicate with some friends we have in U.S.A. It is really amazing .
Apart from this , I do n't spent my free time in technology .
I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends , because technology is not all life , but it is only a little part of it .
Dear Sir / Madam :
I am writing to ask for your advertisement and theatre show .
I am a student in Liverpool , and recently I had a week 's holiday in London .
First day in London , I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me .
But I was really disappointed it .
First of all , there was only one actor that is different from your advertisement .
Also , it is certain to me to buy a discounted tickets cause I was a student .
But , it was not available .
Second , I go to the theatre exactly seven thirty in the evening .
However the show started 45 minutes later .
I wasted time too much in waiting .
It is not good for me , cause I have only one week holiday in London .
Moreover the theatre restaurant is closed with the word " Stuff vacation " at the front door after the show .
It is absolutely different from your leaflet .
On the whole , I am really disappointed at that time .
Could you do me my half of money back .
I enclose my phone number and address .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully
Lo son line .
Fashion for the future .
Have you ever seen a film star wars ?
And did you notice something in fashion in the future ?
I think the people will wear convenient clothes for simple designs in the future .
Because the people will stay at home more than now to their computer .
And they will use soft cosy clothing like cotton and silk .
However , if they have some special day when like important public day or special day of their lives , they will wear very different kinds of clothes which are you never seen before .
Some of that will be very strange to our eyes , but some others will be familiar to us .
And they will use the most kinds of things like small stones of diamond etc .
Maybe some people being naked .
It will be very interesting ...
Just imagine the way in future people 's lives .
And you can see their clothes also .

Dear Mrs Ryan ,
Thank you very much for your letter .
I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize .
First of all because I had never been to California and second because it 's the first time I have ever won something .
The only time that is possible for me to travel is July , because I was working at a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday .
For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live here in Greece .
The activity I would like mot to do are climbing and surfing .
In my free time I had climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say , that I am quite good at climbing .
But I have never ' surfed ' in my living , so that is an activity I have to learn .
Last but not least there are some things I would like to know : What kind of weather did you have in California ?
Is it very hot ?
What kind of clothes should I bring with me ?
And what about money ?
How much money should I take with me ?
Are there any activity which was not included ?
And my last question : how many people are going to stay in each tent .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely
Many people , especially women , love shopping .
If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat .
But shopping is not always enjoyable .
First of all because of the big variety in the store .
Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from , not , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , Adidas or Fila .
And very often you have to pay a lot of money on the product you want .
Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded .
Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people .
And many people are in a hurry , so do n't wonder if other people have not tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping car .
Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping is n't always great fun , but the last cause , which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal .
That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where no one has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me , no one to talk to and no one to complain .
That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little store , where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complain about .
Dear Mrs Helen Ryan ,
I am writing as reply to your letter , I am glad to have won the first prize of your competition in two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because
I got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month holiday each year and on the other months I will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays in these months .
With the accommodation , I would prefer tents because it is more according to the camp .
And with the activities I must chose Photography and Painting because I am not very good at sport and I thought I was doing well in these things .
Finally I just ask you what kind of clothes do I have to bring with me , and around how much money do you think I would need .
Thank you very much for everything .
Your Sincerely

Dear Kim ,
Here I am , writing you to tell everything about my wonderful experience at the concert .
You ca n't imagine how much did I enjoy that journey .
I started early in the morning helping to carry the stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played , I helped with the music stuff like speakers , mics , lights , sound , etc .
And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert starts .
And I am helping them fix the last details .
When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and testy .
After the concert I only help to tidy up the place and make sure that everything was under control and clean .
Later the band is talking to me , I could get their new album free , and some other souvenirs from the band .
But the thing that particularly liked me was that I could do all kinds of things just for one day and I could feel different emotions .
So , that was everything that I can tell you , I enjoyed a lot and I hope to have another experience like this .
Thank you for the letter you have sent recently .
It was a surprise to know that I won the first prize .
The reason I was really writing , However , is to give you some details of my trip to California .
I 'll be taking an English examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it 's the only month I can spend abroad this year .
In the letter you said that accommodation provided can be either tent or log cabin .
I would prefer to stay in tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with nature as well as the scenery around .
Another thing I would like to choose from the activity list is singing ( because I took part in a chorus of school ) and photography .
I 'm really good taking pictures , it 's the way I have to express my feelings .
I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes have we bring .
Do you think you could also let me know how much money we will need during our stay at the camp .
I would be grateful if you could send me a brochure and a map showing where the camp is .
Thank you in anticipation .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
What a surprise it was to get letters from you after all this time .
Sorry I haven't written for so long but I was really busy trying to apply for a job .
This is just to let you know of whom
I work .
In order to celebrate the 125 anniversary in the city , the Count Council organised an open air concert .
It was a summer night and all citizens , as well as tourists , had the opportunity to attend .
The pop band " five " arrived into town and need people to help with not only the organisation but also the stage and sound .
I know some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager .
I could n't believe when he said : " O.K. if you want to help , here is a list of what you can do .
" My job is to leave some leaflets with shops , restaurants and street .
Working with this band is an experience I will never forget .
What I really enjoyed was being part of the staff .
Although I was too nervous , I knew I could do the job well .
I 'd love to hear all your news , why do n't you come and visit me ?
Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Love to ,

Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to complain about a musical show on 10 June , and I was very disappointed .
I was promised that the starring was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw just other stars that were completely difference to your brooch .
To make the matter worse , I am travelling to London to see this famous star
But I did n't see any shows for them .
It makes me a bit angry .
According to your brochure , it is starting to show in 19.30 p.m.
But it was started at 20.15 p.m. I wanted to sleep and very annoying .
More than that ,
When I bought the ticket I do n't get any discounts .
I had to pay full prise .
I was promised that after showing I could go to theatre restaurant but due to start
Later we also finished late therefore , when I went to the restaurant they were definitely closed .
I am very hungry and tired .
You say that it was a perfect evening out but it was n't like that .
I would like to refund some money back .
I paid for the show £ 50.00 I also have a recited to prove it .
I would like you to give my money back as soon as possible .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Kahuna Jena
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I have a really good , friends , Pat who I was trusted and counting on her .
I have known her for five years .
And we were loved each other very much .
One day , I was falling in love with close friends .
I went out with him sometimes
And we are happy .
My boy friend was very handsome , clever and very polite .
We were tested in the same class at school and he also knew Pat as well .
Personally , I wanted to keep secret because I afraid that we might have split up .
And I would like to make sure that he is really love me .
My boy friend told me that he wanted to surprise his friend in his class when the time comes .
To be honest , I wanted to share this felling of someone else but I need to keep very secret .
I felt unhappy sometimes .
One day I decided to tell my best friend - Pat who I realised - with her .
I told her everything bat my boyfriend and when we were meeting each other and vertically we were falling in love .
After I told her I felt my feelings had been released and I am happy .
I also told her to keep very secret did n't telling anyone in the class .
On Monday morning , I walked into the class and all of my friends were shouting at me and called my name and my boyfriend .
I am absolutely embarrassed
And I want to ran out of the class .
I feel very angry about Pat and I should n't had told her about my boy friend .
I feel regret but too late it was n't secret any more now .

Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I received your letter and I am very excited about the camp .
I would like to go in July I do n't mind for two weeks but it has to be that month because in June I still in school and in August I'am going on holiday with my family .
I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it 's different from where I sleep every night so I would appreciate it if there are still tents available .
One of the activities I would prefer to do is climbing , I haven't does a lot of it but I 've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better at it .
The other activity I would like to take is tennis , I 'm quite good at it and I have been practising for four years .
I would like to know what type of clothes I should take and also if I need to take money from me .
Thanks for your attention .
Yours sincerely ,
Ma .

Dear Kim ,
Hello girls how are you doing this day .
I was great especially last weekend at a concert of Backstreet Boys .
It was so exciting .
They were given two concerts one on Friday and the other one on Saturday
They invited me to go on Friday .
This is what happened :
When I arrived they told me that I was helping to backstage with the scenery , then the group arrived , we chatted for like 15 minutes then they had to go on stage .
Here is where the good part starts , I was doing the courtiers ( opening and closing ) when Nick came to me and asked me to go on stage with him , my heart started beating very hard .
The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing to the Backstreet Boys .
I had a great time that day .
Well I have to go now .
Hope to hear from you later on .
Love ,
Anne .
Dear Sir / Madam The Circle Theatre manager
I am writing to complain about your product .
I would like you to back my money because that is not same as your advertisement .
I was planning to spend my holiday in London when I found your advertisement .
In the advertisement , you mention actors , timing , price discounts and equipment .
DANNY brook is one of my favorite actors so I decided to buy a ticket even if I cancel my appointment for that day at 18=30 and also notice of price discount impressed me .
However , when I went to the theatre , you did n't anything not only discount but also apologize us for days of starting musical .
In addition different actors appeared on the stage and I could n't had dinner with the musical because the restaurant has been closed .
It makes me so disappointing and angry .
You should back my money immeasurably because that night were far from perfect .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Faithfully ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
He always tried to say nothing and do .
But everyone always noticed he had secret from his face .
Whenever he has secret , his nose moved quickly .
He had not liked this habit and had thought it was worst of him until he solved a big crime .
When all money had gone to the bank , nobody there except Pat .
Bank robbers said him if Pat told the fact somebody they killed him .
So .
Pat did n't say anything .
But his nose moved quickly when police showed a picture of bank robbers .
Then police realized who are bank robbers and arrested them .
Although bank robbers complained about Pat , he said nothing to anybody .
He just moved his nose ! !
Thanks to his habit , he is still alive and all money is backed by the bank .
The town became peace again .
Dear Mr or Madam ,
I am writing to express my disappointment in the play " over the rainbow " which is performing at Circle Theatre .
First of all , the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actors .
Surprisingly , he never appeared on the stage , during the play .
Therefore , the theatre or the company was lying .
Secondly , the show started one hour fifteen past after .
We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show begins .
Finally , when I asked about the discounts , an aggressive employee refused to answer me .
He stayed looking at me and laughing .
It was incredible .
The evening was a horrible surprise , completely different from the promised wrote in the advertisement .
Defineteley , I want my money back as soon as possible .
I am looking forward to hearing from you
Yours faithfully
" Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
" I know that
But I would prefer to trust her so I told everything about Lynne Harper , our new college at school .
However , I have to admit that I told her my own opinion .
Well , it was the beginning of my tragedies .
So , I told Pat that Lynne was ugly , fat like a cow , and extremely aggressive .
But I could n't shut my mouth , I continued : " You ca n't believe it Pat , she wears trousers like men and green flowery blouses "
Of course , my friend and I were laughing during half an hour .
Two days after , when Pat came back to my school and she met Mr Harper , our head teacher , she told everything about Ann1 .
In that precisely moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Carter 's niece .
I know it 's my fault .
But , well , unhappiness starting with Pat and my revealing secrets .
Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I 've been recently seen in your theatre during my week 's holiday in London I must say I had a very disappointing evening !
I am sure this was the London 's newest and best musical show I have ever seen because of the good publicity you made in your advertisement , but I thought completely wrong !
Firstly , the play started nearly an hour later as I expected !
If the spectacle has been beautiful , I would have been quite pleased to wait .
Then , I have read that there would have been discounts available , but it was n't true !
So it 's better not to write anything if you do n't make it true then .
Finally , I hoped that , after these incidents , I would enjoy myself , but there was another change of programme : stars !
The main actor , Danny Brook , was changed and the one who played his part was n't as good as I expected .
Finished the show , I went to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed and this hasn't been said before .
Moreover , I was shocked at the reasons for which it was closed : the chef went away after he received a phone call !
For all these reasons , I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon !
A suggestion ?
Organize better your shows and do not exaggerate in publicity !
Yours sincerely ,
There would be many things to say .
Technology is the wide field which increases very quickly .
It 's creating an artificial world , where everything is electronic and fast .
I 'm not sure if I must say technology has changed our lives for positive or not .
Certainly , thanks to it , we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago .
Nowadays , we make a phone call to an astonishing rapidity , instead of my grandparents ' time it took one month or more to have contact with people abroad , because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow !
When appear the first car , it is already a great success .
Before that , people travelled by horse or worse .
Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America , Australia or wherever else he wanted !
What can I say about the television ?
It allows us to keep connections with the other states in the world , improved our knowledge , offering us news , advising us to events which happened or will happen .
In the not very far 1914 , parents sent their sons to war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead !
It was terrible !
Despite this , I 'm convinced all this progress caused some damage to the community , not only physically .
We pay less attention to our lives , to those things which give us happiness , that is n't money , success , power .
We become passive people , we followed the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed .
I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make him known for who he is , not for his money , but for his ability , his good habits , his personality .
Finally , everyone should decrease his own life 's rhythms .
Mr John Smythe ,
I 'm writing to tell you of the horrible evening I had on Friday .
I was very excited by the idea of going to the theatre , but it did n't work out as I thought it would .
First of all the stars actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , Tina did act , but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I do n't recall .
Second of all , the play was supposed to start at 19:30 , but it started to 20:15 .
I 'm not used to waste my time sitting in a chair waiting , I do have better things to do with it .
Another thing I want to complain about , is that your advertising that discounts were available , but there are n't any discount at all .
To finish my " marvelous " evening , I want to eat at your restaurant , but it was closed and no reason was given .
As I did n't have a " perfect evening out " , I think I have the right to ask for my money back .
I hope you understand .
Yours faithfully
Pat 's story
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Now you 've probably asked yourself what does it mean , well , now I 'm going to explain it to you .
Two years ago in this school , Pat and I used to be best friends .
We used to tell everything to each other .
I was having some family problems , so my marks were getting down and down .
Pat was worried , she did n't knew what to do .
One day she looked me in the eye with a sharp deep look ,
Never have I seen such a deep look : and asked me what was happening and I tell her as I always used to .
That afternoon she visited me and told me the plan she had designed to make my mark rises .
It consisted of stealing a school list from the computer , in other words , hacking the school software .
I thought it was a great idea ,
So I stole from ten tests we were planning to do .
Pat could n't stand the pressure of the " crime " so she told the school directors that I stole the tests .
I was punished , nearly expert , but Pat did n't received any punishment .
I never accused her of lying , and
I you ask me why , I really do n't know .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to you after visiting your theatre .
Frankly speaking , I was very disappointed after my visit .
I was displeased at the very beginning , because I expect to get a discount as I 'm a student .
According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there are no discounts for all .
But nevertheless I decided to go on your show .
The show started t 20.15 instead of 19.30 .
I had to wait at overcrowded hall .
When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor .
One of the reasons for my visit your show was Danny Brook 's participation .
So , you could understand how disappointed I was .
To make matters worse the restaurant which is mentioned in your advertising was closed .
So I had n't such perfect evening , as was promised in your advertising .
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertising and I would be grateful if you could give me back a part of my money .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
How has modern technology changing your daily life ?
In my opinion , modern technology plays an important role in people 's lives .
I think that at present the most important technologies are computers and Internet technology .
Both computers and Internet influence people 's lives .
I had to use computers every day .
It helped me in preparing my homework .
Firing on all Internet gives you access to a great number of different information .
On the one hand internet is often used for entertainment , but on the other hand it 's also used in different business and education process !
With the help of Internet technology I communicate with other people from all over the world it gives me chance to improve my english .
From my point of view , internet can be used for education , because it gives the opportunity to have distant relations between pupils and teachers .
Though Internet has a lot of positive aspects I think you should be careful with it and not to be depended on it .

Dear Sir
At the beginning I would like to thank You for Your letter - it pleases me much .
I have always dreamt about holidays ' in Camp California '
However there are some problems that I hope to solve .
First of all the only suitable time for me to go is July .
It is the only time when I am free to my duties - I am a doctor so you saw that I could not let my patients down .
If we are talking about accommodating then accommodation in tents would be great - I love being close to nature .
I would like You to know also from my two hobby : swimming and surfing .
I was not told about some kind of achievement in those disciplines but It is my big passion
I hope to have a chance to practice both in theme of ' Camp California ' .
There is also one thing that I would like to ask You .
The question is :
Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take on this trip ?
Yours sincerely
Anna Nowak
Uncontested part of every people life is shopping .
We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this is money .
As a teenager I must admit that there is nothing more enjoyable for shopping .
It 's like , , walking in the clouds , , you feel like flying .
Choosing gave me such big pleasure because I never had to worry about here do I take money from my wishes .
It all came from my parents .
All I ought to do is buy and choose .
I think that , , has been a dream '' for all of us .
It 's hard for me even to imagine a situation when shopping is not enjoyable .
Probably it is one of the moments when you want something badly and you ca n't have it .
Another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present .
Everybody knows that , , present presents a problem '' You know your own task but what about the task with the other person ?
However I ca n't agree with opinion that , , shopping is not always enjoyable ''
I think that everybody likes to buy but not everybody likes to see pleasure from it .
Dear Mrs. Helen
I 'm writing back to answer the questions that you send me in the past letter , so referred to the question of when I would like to travel , I would like to go anytime during July , because I have to be in august back home , because I need to apply and get everything sorted out , to go into college next September .
And according to the question of which type of accommodation I prefer , I chose a log cabin , because I think that the tent is more messy , so I would appreciate if you give me the cabin .
And my answer to the question of which activities I would like to choose , well I choose swimming cause is my daily exercise and surfing .
Anyway I 'm not very good doing surfing but with a little bit of help I know I can make it .
Oh , at last I just would like to ask you how many clothes , and money I have to bring with me .
And well Mrs Helen I would really appreciate if you sent me back a letter with all the answers to my questions , anyway .
Thank you very very much and please keep in contact with e - mail , as normal mail .
Yours truly

Dear Kim :
I hope you kept in great form , like you were the last time I saw you , how is your family , I hope everyone is OK .
Well here in Dublin things still the same , but I think somebody told you that I went to the mob concert here at the point which is the big theatre for events and concerts
, I guess it was the best concert I 've ever been to , but the cool thing is that , well do you remember my friend Luke , the one that works as a security guard , well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage , so I go to help them and everything else , and when I get into the point , do you who was there ?
Just imagine , it was mob , so I went to say hello to him , and he told me would you give me a hand with my decks , so I went , and when we finished he gave me a T - shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row , oh my god Kim that the best thing that ever happened to me , well Kim I hope to receive a letter from you soon , and please tell everybody about the mob concert and everything , thank you .
See you soon
Love

13th June 2000

Is wonderful for me to have an opportunity to visit the camp California in the U.S.A.
In answer to your letter .

And the second question .
About accommodation during these two weeks at the camp I would prefer log cabins ; because maybe be more interesting to share with other people .
In other hands you ask me I have a chance to choose two activities while I am in the camp . but is no easy , because all is very interesting for me .
But anyway I like more to have the possibility to practicing climbing and surfing .
Meanwhile , these activities are developed .

Shopping is not always enjoyable .
I think this topic is so exciting for the anthropologist and psychological point of view , because we can study the reaction before , during and after shopping .
People in general have a compulsory actitud about shopping in my opinion .
Because sometimes the article about to buy is not really necessary .
We must accept that media have so important effect on our lives in special the T.V.
For the men and women is important the appearance and they spend a lot of money to buy clothes , cosmetics , accessories , jeweled etc .
And the other they choose sometimes just for the label .
Without giving really importance to the calidad in reference to an appearance there was more preparation for the food area , because people in general they do n't spent the time to prepare food and when they shop they choose pre - prepared food .
We know is more easy for these busy life .
In the other hand the facility to access to mall center is not good .
The area for parking , space to play grown by the children or bus station near the mall is not really appropriate .
Otherwise shopping will be more enjoyable .
I think of the nearly future we need to decide on the government .
Which are special places in the town we left just in commercial areas , but of course with all the facilities to get there like a big supermarket , and mall centre in different areas of the city .
DEAR SIR ,
I AM WROTE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL SHOW
THAT ARE TAKING PART IN A CIRCLE THEATRE .
I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE PLAY IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY .
THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ THE STARRING .
IT SAID : ' DANNY BROOK ' .
BUT , WHEN I WAS WATCHING
THE PLAY , I REALISED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND , REALLY , I AM DISAPPOINTED .
ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAVE TO WAIT .
I THINK IT WILL BE AT 19.30 AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES ! !
BESIDES THIS , I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT AT THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED .
IN ADDITION TO THIS , I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT ON MY TICKET .
SO , I HAVE TO
PAY
A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETELY DISASTER .
TO SUM UP , I DO NOT SPEND
THE PERFECT EVENING .
I THINK THAT IT IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD .
ON THE WHOLE , I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK .
YOURS FAITHFULLY
MANUELA BEARABLE
JUST BE YOURSELF
FOR , THE FUTURE , PEOPLE WILL BE WEARING FASHIONABLE CLOTHES LIKE NOW .
PEOPLE WILL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR .
ONE THE ONE HAND , THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR FASHIONABLE CLOTHES .
THIS PEOPLE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE .
ON THE OTHER HAND , THERE WILL BE LESS PEOPLE WHO WOULD
WEAR WHATEVER THEY LIKE .
NOWADAYS , PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ALWAYS WORRIED .
ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING , WHAT ARE THEY LOOK LIKE AND
THEY WASTE
A LOT OF MONEY ON CLOTHES .
ON THE WHOLE , CLOTHES WILL HAVE NO CHANGE .
IN MY OPINION , PEOPLE WILL GIVE IMPORTANCE TO HOW THEIR PERSONALITIES DEVELOP AND THEY WILL GIVE UP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR .
THEY WOULD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHAT THEY NEED AND ARE HAPPY WITH IT .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , that I went to see at the 16th to June .
Firstly , the actor supposed to be Danny Brook , but he is not , it was another actor , who I have never seen before , so , as you can imagine , I am very disappointed .
Another complain is about the time that the musical show started , the advertisement said it started at 19:30 , but it did not , we had to wait 45 minutes .
It was terrible .
Now , with the tickets , were different prices but there were not discounting , and because of this , many people could not see the show , especially students .
Finally , when the musical show finished , and I have to say , a bit late , I went to the theatre 's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone .
At is explained it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Pat , Maria 's best friend
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him , in fact , she was so angry she almost kill
But , she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
Maria talked to Pat about the stupid things that she did , but Pat refused to apologize to her , because she felt it was n't a mistake and she did it for only one reason : help Maria to get the man that she loved .
Maria was speechless , it was the first time that she did n't knew what to do , so she decided to stop talking to pat .
After 3 weeks , Maria got ill
So she was not available to go to school .
Some friends phoned her everyday , except Pat , the only friends that Maria really loved , despite that , she was not sad .
One day , when Maria was seated in her bedroom , someone knocks the door , it was Manuel , he was worried about her .
Maria was nervous , but for the first time , she could talk to him as she never did before , and at the end of the day , she was the happiest person in the world , she gave her first kiss and she had Pat 's friendship back , after all , everything happened because of her .
Warsaw , 12th December 2000
Dear Mr Robertson ,
First of all , we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderful trip with an interesting program .
We are all extremely excited especially because of the trip to Greenwich , the town we are always interested in .
However , there are may other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London .
For example , at the time of our visit there was going to be "
The London fashion and Leisure Show " .
It was a coincidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage of .
This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have autographed .
We hope change the excursion programs a little would not cause any problems .
Our suggestion is to visit Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
Because the fashion show last a whole day long .
We are ready to give up our shopping and free time .
The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day .
We are sorry for any inconvenience caused to our request .
Yours faithfully
Famous people are living creatures .
They breathe , eat , feel and beside that they were famous
They are just the same as anyone else .
Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy .
I personally think the best would be to put the celebrity in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for authorship .
Like in the zoo .
The biggest commercial gain in history I believe , but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way .
On the other hand , they must have done something to become famous .
It may in many cases , not be true but we could suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private lives separately connected to it .
To sum up , I believe that everyone has the right to keep privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserve to have a private life .
Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain from publishers , journalists and photographers , famous people will just have to get used to this living " under a microscope " .
Dear Jane Clark ,
The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Festival I attended last weekend .
I believe that the event was good , however I felt that the festival could be improved next year .
Firstly I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic , but your advertisement it was said that I would find stars and artists from around the world , when , in fact , they were in only six countries .
I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to go to the festival , but it would be nice if next year we could meet other personalities .
Secondly I believe you should know that a lot of people , including me , are not able to enjoy concerts because some concert halls were too small .
I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there would be more plays and films next year .
Last but not least I would like you to know that I think the idea of a weekend tickets for all events are excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separately .
I hope you find my opinion useful .
Once again congratulations to the festival .
I hope to hear from you soon
Yours sincerely ,
Tipped to earn money
When the holidays began everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do , but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem for most of us .
There are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time .
One of the most common examples was baby- sitting taking care of little children is easy and it does n't require special skills , all you need is a lot of patience .
If looked after children do n't fits you , you can try to pets .
Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk .
So if you like animals this is your chance to earn money and have fun at the same time .
Another option is to wash your neighbour 's car .
In this case you need to buy the materials you would work with , but do n't worry , soap is not very expensive .
The most important thing is that you wisely chose the most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .
If you do n't find anything good enough for you do n't worry , you should always remember : It 's not all about the money !

Dear Ms Ryan
I am writing to reply to your letter I received yesterday .
I am very proud that I won first prize in your competition and I am extremely happy to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
At the beginning I would like to answer questions you ask me about your letter .
The most appropriate months for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off ( I was in charge of project which starts in June
So I was sure I could n't go later ) .
' As I had a choice I would prefer to stay in log cabins in tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so depended on weather conditions .
As I was requesting I should choose two activities on the list .
So I decided to choose climbing and photography .
These two are easy to connect , I could climb and making pictures at the same time .
I am very keen to photography .
Last year I took part in photographer 's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in category of , , beautiful scenery '' .
Climbing , by contrast , is something I started few months ago , so I have not gained any success in this sport .
But you could give me a chance to get more familiar with it .
I would like to ask for clothing .
Do I need any formal one ?
I would like also to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is .
I want to thank you one more for taking me into consideration in your competition .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely

Have you ever been to a big supermarket and try to find something you really like or want , looking through shelves and not finding that in the end .
What do you feel ?
You have to be disappointed .
There are a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping .
You might spend too much money and buy something you do n't really need .
You could also buy something which later turned out to be out of order .
So you have to complain about it .
Very often the shop assistant was not helpful so you lose your money and your time .
Moreover , you could face an aggressive and maybe even drunk shop assistants or manager .
This led to an escalation of your anger .
Sometimes you could find a bargain .
You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price .
But at home you noticed that there was a tear on sleeves .
And you could n't of course give it back because the price is lowered and your dress is not under guarantee .
You could also face an unpleasant situation connected with money .
Somebody could give you not enough change .
How would you feel ?
Deceived ?
So if you do n't want to feel deceived or offended , think twice before you decide to go shopping .
( A very depressing point of view , is n't it ? )
To Mr Robertson ,
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the programme that you provide .
It was very good programmes , especially the river trip in Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class would enjoy .
However , our class had spotted an advertisement in the London fashion and Leisure Show and would all wishing to attend .
It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March .
It will be at 10.00 till 7.00pm .
The show will be on all the latest fashion , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
We would also not having to worry financially as it is free for students .
This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and styles we might also get a change to meet new people and interest in them .
The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change to go .
I have a few suggestions for how the programme could be changed to fit the London fashion and Leisure Show .
We could do as planned on Monday and move go to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon .
We would have to forgo the shopping as we may not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping .
We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show .
Lastly , I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go on the show .
I hope you would consider this matter .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Everyday , something changed and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books , dentists use modernizing electrical items instead of just the pliers , even homes are effected .
From letters of emails , from gas stoves with electric stoves and microwaves , but we are n't just going to stop here are we ?
No , in the future , the present will be the past and these things now new use would be old , outdated and change .
I see a very different home for us in the future .
Most things will be computerised .
We might even be using voice identification and fingerprinting instead of keys .
We the on and off lights in touch pads and remote controllers .
We might even be able to open the door without getting out of the living room .
Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole of your door .
Although all that may change our houses may be still the same .
The rooms and size should remain as it is and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style .
We may still favour that old carpet and couches .
The furniture should not change that much from the outside and the amount of room should not change too .
In the future , every child might have a laptop .
And instead of going to school , why not let schools come to you ?
We will be learning at home using computers and discs .
Never had to leave the house or wake up so early .
Another way our homes could be different in the future is probably the utilities we are using .
We might not need maid to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot , the machine , or something others for the same purpose .
Our homes would still be the same in terms of the kitchen , it will still be filled with vegetables and meat .
This is because people wo n't miss the great taste of food although it could be submitted to a vitamin pill or two .
Lastly , I think that all this change wo n't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead abruptly .
People will be able to adjust and change with the times .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London fashion and Leisure show , that we saw advertised and we are interested indeed .
In addition we would like to thank you for the programme .
Firstly , I would like to give you some details of this show .
It will take place in Central Exhibition Hall , in London , on Tuesday 14th of March and a suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00
I would like to mention that this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going on shopping , so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students !
The most important thing is that the times that the show starts is perfect and are suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping .
Secondly , I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly what does it include .
The latest fashion will be on show and also the leisure and sports wear .
Really interesting !
Moreover all on the make up and the hairstyles .
I think that it would be a great opportunity for all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London .
But , if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon , the same hour with shopping , I suggest having a shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do !
I look forward to your reply ,
Yours sincerely ,
Some people think that to be a famous person is very exciting thing , that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well .
I believe , that if somebody wants the fame and the glory must be totally sure about the results .
For example , the politicians have chosen their careers , they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful with their movements or else they are going to have bad reputation , and they will be not trustworthy .
Another successful carriers such as , film stars must also be balanced .
If somebody is a film star this mean that has got a different kind of life , more comfortable , more interesting but it does n't means that he or she ca n't are like normal people even if he or she is a star .
If somebody wants to be famous of course must be at the top and the mass media will be following him or her .
But I think that is limited .
Everybody deserves to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer .
It does n't matter what kind of career or job you are following .
You must control your behaviour and try not improve so much yourself .
And finally the journalists should know how to respect the private lives of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you a great opportunity you give us , especially with planned all this programme in such acute way .
I think that this programme has a good organisation , as you know , due to we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points .
But , I was wondering , like a student of this college , if we would change part of this programme ... we 'd like to go to the London fashion and Leisure Show .
It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins to ten o'clock .
In this way , we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and , we can go to the show .
Front my point of view , we are very interested in the latest fashions like a leisure , sports wear , make up , hairstyle , you know ...
I strongly believe that we will be at the right time and best city to appreciate it .
Please let me know if you are agreeing with us !
Oh I forgot about it !
Besides , this show is greed ( another posit points ) .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
FANCY GETTING TO KNOW THE FUTURE ?
Do you think you 've the future in your hand ?
Do you think we 're living like old times ?
Would you like living in a modern way ?
What do you expect in the future ?
Can you compare it ... ?
Are you afraid ?
Well , you can look at your house ...
Nowadays , we have all kinds of instruments to washing up the dishes , from cooking to be more comfortable , for example the TV , a video recorder , etc .
Maybe , in a few years later we 'll have a big TV , a more suitable radio but , from my point of view , I think these facts will not change the way of our lives .
We will be able to accelerate the process of the computer 's game for example ...
But not in a strange way you can imagine ...
I mean I do n't thinks we 'll change cars by aeroplane ...
In this way , you have to be calm because as you know the things are developing in the same way you'r changes , too .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that the house of the future will be the house of the new kindness it will be a very posit point by opening our files .
So , we have a future in our hands !
Think about it .
Dear principal , first of all , we would like to thank you for good programme which provides us 3 day stay in London .
It contains a wide range of activities for example , sightseeing , river trip , visiting science museum and gallery , shopping .
It is certain that the programme will give students considerable enjoyment .
However , we have found an advertisement for a London fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall to 14th in March .
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles etc .
Moreover , students are allowed to admit for free .
All of us would like to attend the show because young people , particularly girls are interested in fashion and make up , so we are expecting the show will be a great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like .
It would be grateful if you give a little change in programme so that we are able to attend the show .
It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th into the London fashion and Leisure show , instead of the science museum and shopping .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Technical and Warm Home people 's way of life has considerably was changed from rapidly developing modern technologies .
To begin with , it would be good to look back at how our parents had lived in the house .
50 years ago , Korean mother should have made the fire by burning wood to warm the room up and make food .
Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their lives have been far easier than before .
Today , however , people do not need to spend many times by making food , washing up , or even from turning on an off the light .
Machines , such as a dish washer , laundry machine and remote controller helps us jut to relax or do a little work necessary .
From my point of view , people 's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which was devised in every machine , TV , cooker and a light , connecting to the owner .
He /
She can just press a button or send e - mail to operate what he / she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .
On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which was constructed in a " family " .
In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer , but by parents themselves .
Computer might know better than humans , but there are many things which it could not replace in our lives .

Dear Ms Helen Ryan
Competition organisers
I have just received the letter , which lets me know that I have won the first prize .
I am proud of winning it and would like to say how thankful I am .
I am therefore writing to give you my further information .
First of all , I was a student and would like to travel in July .
Because I intend to take examination in September .
So I can afford to go on holiday only in July .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents .
It will be my first time to experience to stay there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried .
The next consideration is the activity .
Actually , I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident about it .
And nowadays , I have been practicing tennis as school activities .
Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis .
Finally , I am considering what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need .
I would be most grateful if you could give me further advisable information .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
Hello !
I hope everything around you is alright .
You might not believe but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much .
So I 'm now writing to let you know how grateful it was .
All work I needed to do was n't very interesting .
Which I must have set thousands chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely .
The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist on setting chair just before they started practicing .
I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of stages .
Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as audience .
It was absolutely fantastic .
I have ever never sat down there .
Additionally , you could n't believe , but the vocalist said " all the chair you are sitting down were set on him , " pointing at me ! !
Actually I am a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memories .
Anyway it was so interesting times that I did n't even feel tired after that .
Finally , I suggest you should try as I do if you have any opportunity .
You must like it .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you soon .
Can you send me a letter back writing what happens to you recently .
Bye !
Love ,
At the beginning I would like to thank you .
Now I am going to give you some further information I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in high school and this is most important year of my life I am studying for university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then by the end of June I will be having university entrance exam after that in July I am going to be alright .
I would prefer tents because I have never stayed in tents before
And I am wondering how it is going to be like
And among these activities I am choosing basketball and swimming .
Basketball because I was very good at it , swimming because I like to swim very much but I 'm not a very good swimmer .
And finally I would like to ask you some questions .
My first question is about clothes ; what kind of clothes do we need to take with us ?
And how much money do we need to take ?
Finally what kind of weather is waiting for us ?
Thank you for every thing
Your sincerely
Osman
Dear Ms Ryan ,
I am enthusiastic about receiving your letter .
I will give you all the necessary information .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I would be free from work , my current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
I would prefer to stay in tents rather than in log cabins , because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different .
As far as the activities are concerned , I have chosen to do tennis and swimming .
I am good at playing tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be a useful training for me .
Moreover I would like to know what kind of clothes are the best for living in the camp and if I need to bring with me a large amount of money .
I want to thank you for this prize , let me know if you need further information .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Bianca Botticelli
Dear Kim ,
In your last letter you asked me about the concert ...
Oh it was fantastic !
I 've always loved music so work in a concert was great .
You ca n't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of the concert , apart from the musicologists and the singers , there are people who work with lighting , who organized the security service ...
It was so exciting !
My work consisting of checking the tickets , a number of them and took the people to their seats .
It was also very tiring because all the people arriving at the same time and they did n't want to wait for my help ; so they went around the theatre , looking for their seats and making so much noise .
Sometimes I think that people never grow up , if they have been a class of children , they would have made less noise ! !
Anyway , it was a great experience in spite of these little problems .
Now I have to go , wrote soon and let me know what you have been doing .
Lots of love
Bianca

Dear Helen :
I 've received your letter and I am pleased to have won because I need some days to relax myself and to leave the city , which was very distressing .
I only can travel in July because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it 's the month he can give me , so I hope it is n't a problem for you .
To spend the two weeks I would prefer to live in tents , that is in my opinion a way to be nearer the environment and the animals , although I do n't mind living in log cabins .
In spite of liked all the sports you wrote in your letter I was only good at climbing and sailing , because I am used to practise them with my father since I was a child .
I have got a doubt , it is not very important , but I would like to know if I need any money or all is paid , the kind of clothes I should wear , if the weather is good or bad ... and all the extra information you can send me .
Thank you very much for the prize .
Yours faithfully .
Eliza Vasquez .
Why people like so much go shopping ?
In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kinds of things for her family , so for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best products and the cheapest price to save some money .
Otherwise , there are people who think the opposite ; such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they go to buy hardly ever , only when they need clothes or something for their job or school .
In that way shopping can be as funny as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation of the future .
To sum up , all you made in small quantities is good and funny , but do n't increase them if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .
Dear Ms Ryan
Thank you for your letter .
I am so happy to hear that I had won a two week holiday in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel in July .
I am going to finish my exams in June , and I was planning to go back to China in early August .
So if I could travel in July , and come back before 6th of August , that would be great .
I would prefer living in tents with log cabins .
I have never had any experience to live in the tent , so I would like to give it a go .
I think I will enjoy myself in a tent .
I loved swimming , but I am not any good for swimming .
I really wanted to learn how to swim .
I was wondering if there is a coach could give us a lesson during the camp .
Also , I would like to join basketball team , I used to play basketball when I was in high school , and our high school basketball team has won many competitions during last ten years in our city .
I am glad I have taken part in a few competitions , and I am so proud of our basketball team .
Would you tell me that how much money you would give it to me and how is the weather like in U.S.A.
Thank you for every thing !
Yours faithfully
Dear Kim ,
It was great to hear from you , haven't seen you since last summer holiday , hope everything is fine with your place .
You want to hear about my experience with the pop concert which I enjoy helping last month ?
I must say that was great fun , I 've never had this kind of experience before .
Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets , they are list of pop band and group which will appear at the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds .
After that , I had to help people who have a ticket but ca n't find their seats .
During the concert , I did n't has a lot to do , so I had chance to see most of the performance
, that was excellent .
I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars .
During break time I did give a lot of direction from people who ca n't find toilet , and information such as where they could have a cup of coffee .
That is bit boring , but it is part of my job .
I got to go .
Write to you next time .
Love

Dear Ms Ryan ,
I am writing in response to your letter to the first prize in the competition .
I am very looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July , because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month .
About accommodation , I would prefer log cabin , because I have a problem with my back .
Therefore , I need to sleep in a bed .
Also tents were not fairly comfortable .
As far as camp activities concerned , I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years , for that reason , I am fairly interested in sailing .
On the other hand , I keen on painting , however , I have never painted my life , so I would like to try it .
Finally , I was wondering what kind of clothes I have to wear in California ?
In addition , could you advice me how much money I need for the trip ? and is there anything else do I have to know ?
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours Sincerely

Hello Kim ,
I 've received your letter two days ago and I 'm quite happy to know that you passed F.C.E. I 'm about and let me tell you about my last experience .
I went to Madrid last week
And I was walking on the street when somebody asked me the address .
I looked at him and I realise that this person was David Bowie .
Yes ! !
!
I could n't believe it .
He was trying to speak Spanish , but his accent is terrible .
So , I started to speak in English about him .
I explained to him where were the street that he was looking for and we carried out of the conversation for a while .
I thought he was very rude , but I was wrong , he was n't arrogant at all and he looked very simply .
I like my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e - mailing address .
Yeah ! !
!
I 'm not joking , I got his e - mail .
Well my friend , I have to go , because I get an appointment with a dentist .
Write me soon and take care .
Best wishes
Dear Helen ,
I learned from you letter that I 've won the first prize .
I felt how luck I was .
I understand you want to know when was I available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
First of all I would be able to go U.S.A in July because of my university .
I was studying Economics and I am very busy nowadays .
My exams will have finished by the end of June .
I will only be able to set off in July and I also would give my thesis from my teacher in August .
This holiday will help me to think and prepare it .
I 'd prefer staying in log cabins because I need a proper place to say and study .
Basically , I do n't like staying in a small tent .
When I got the camp , I 'd like to swim and climb .
I used to climb mountains and is good at climbing .
I am fond of swimming but unfortunately I was not a good swimmer .
I 'd like to ask some questions which I want to know .
Is there any toilet and shower in a log cabin or somewhere nearby ?
Do I have to bring any special clothes ?
Do you have any idea what is the weather going to be ?
How much money do you recommend me to bring with me ?
Is the camp close to town or city ?
Will you provide me the instructor when I climb and swimming ?
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
I haven't write you for ages .
I do apologise for this .
How are you ?
How is your new schools and parents ?
I hope we can catch up on each other 's news .
Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
It was unbelievable and tiring as well .
I saw all the pop bands and singers .
I hear them talking behind the stage .
They signed my diary and took a photo of me .
Being a security guard was the hardest task .
Carrying big speakers place to place was extremely tiring but we have loads of laughs .
Believe it or not I put make up about one famous singer 's face .
I was just walking down by dressing room manager said that if I could help them .
I could n't believe my eyes .
I was in her room and helped her .
Especially I like that time .
I advise you to do something like that .
I 'm going to help them again .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Miss Ryan ,
I 'm writing to you as regards the letter you 've sent me in the competition I 've won .
I 've never been to the U.S.A. before
So I think it 'll be an exciting trip .
With regard to the dates of the trip , July would be good because in June I 'm going to visit my family in Mexico and in August school begins .
I 've never been camped before , I guess I 'm not an outdoor girl , but I 'd like to give it a try , so I 'd rather tents than cabins .
I 'm really keen on sport , especially sailing .
I 've practised sailing since an early age and I perfectly managed the rigging and sailing .
I 'm also fond of tennis , I 've just started my lessons and would like to continue practising during the summer .
So , I think I 'll do sailing and tennis .
I 'm not really sure about what kind of clothes to take , could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable ?
I 'd appreciate it a lot .
Sincerely ,
Diana Delgado
Shopping is not always enjoyable
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable .
For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy , we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
They have invited us and we want them to see us stunningly beautiful .
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsy .
I was so annoyed !
I was at the Plaza Espagnole in Florence without a penny !
My friends lend me some money , but it was n't more than 120 pounds .
I had to buy my dress
, it 's accessories and besides clothing and souvenirs !
I could n't really do much ,
So I use the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs .
I felt really bad seeing my friends bought the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window - shop .

Dear Madam Helen Ryan
First of all , we happy to won the first prize of your competition .
Thank you for choosing our tickets to the final .
We like to go in July , because my wife Catrin just have holidays next month .
We prefer the last two weeks of July .
Would that be fine for you too ?
Is there a possibility to stay in a log cabin .
I have sometimes troubled by backache when I coud't sleep on the flat ground .
It would be great if we could choose swimming and golf .
My wife Catrin is a local master of swimming race .
I m not so good as her , but I 'm going every week once in her training .
In golf , we were both total beginners .
We had no experience but we like to learn this game .
We are both a little afraid , what kind of clothes and shoes we have to take off on us ?
Which temperature will be in the summer season in this area ?
Are there some possibility to rent a golf shoes ?
Finally , we like to know , when you will send us the airline - tickets and a brochure .
Moreover , what do think how much pocket money we will spent on this trip .
We look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully
Leon Hoffman

Dear Kim
Thank you very much for your last lovely letters .
I 'm fine .
How are you ?
You are interest on my last job !
I really like to tell you all my experience .
However , I 'm happy that we finish this hard work .
I worked with a team of seven people .
We were mainly to work on all the lights in this great concert .
Its sound easy , just for the light .
In addition , it was a nine day hard work to mount all the different spot and hundreds of Coblights in the right place .
Finally , we have worked the Kohl night before the concert .
We have to adjust the laser extremes in the correct position .
We spent hours till it was good enough for a technical - manger .
Moreover , the band was exhausted by this great laser show at the end .
For me is this venture one of the best .
It shows , when all members of the group work hard together , you can reach a lot .
I think I ca n't forgotten this experience on my mind
Lots of love
Leon
Dear manager ,
With this letter I want to show you some problems I had last week with your theatre on your show .
First of all , I want to introduce myself .
I 'm Francisco Schein , I 'm 18 years old and I went last week to see your musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I am very upset because the show had many problems .
First the actor was changed and his performance was very poor and disappointing .
Then , the show began 45 minutes later , so we have to wait very long .
The advertisement said there are discounts available , which is not .
At the end you say it will be a restaurant , but it was closed , so we could n't eat anything until we get home .
I hope you understand your faults and I 'm asking you for the money back .
Faithfully Yours
I do n't know if technology has totally changed my life , because I was born with it and I have learned it since I was a little boy .
For example , I was born knowing the man had stepped on the moon .
There are some machines which had helped in my development , and others which helped me to make my life easier .
The computer for example makes communication much easier and faster then in past time , when everything was sent by common mail , and it took weeks till it got the right place .
There are other machines which are bad for the environment .
Many industries threw their contaminated air away , without cleaning it before .
Technology has to move further so it can solve problems as pollution , so we can live better and longer .
Dear Helen
I am very surprised to have received your letter in which you explained to me that I have won prizes in your competition .
After that , I would like to say thanks , I never have won any price at all .
Now , I would answer your request .
In reference to the date of travel , I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at the university and I only have July to take my holiday .
As stated in your letter I have to choose the accommodation types .
I would prefer to stay in tents because since I was a child I have been using this type of accommodation .
I used to go camping .
About camp activities I would prefer to do basketball and photography .
I have chosen these activities because actually I am playing with university teams , and photography are my favourite hobby .
I have recently bought a new camera .
Finally let me know what kind of clothes would be the most suitable for camp .
Are necessarily bring with me money in there ?
I look forward to hearing from you
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim
I am writing to you told about my experience at a pop concert .
It began when ours common friend Martha , offered me to be an organization members of the concert , obviously I accepted .
Now I can tell you that it is an amazing challenge for me because I never do anything like that .
My duties like the organization members are different , the first day I had to pick the bands up at the airport , for it I hired a van .
The following day I was the person who provided the meals for all the organization staff and besides every day I was at the back - stage support the catering staff .
Particularly I am pleased to have known the most popular pop stars in the world .
Hopping to hear from you
Best wishes
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I have recently been in London for spending a week 's holiday .
As I am an enthusiastic about musical I went to see this musical show .
I was very disappointed because the things that are written in the advertisement is not really true .
It is written that the star would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Danny Brook is one of my favorite actors and there is playing another one .
I felt absolutely disappointed .
The musical should have begun at 19:30 , but it started to 20:15 ; it is unacceptable !
It was written too that there are discounts available and I asked for them and they said me that they were n't allowed to do any discount .
After the show me and my friends want to have a drink and a theatre restaurant was closed because there were n't enough drinks .
As you said in your advertising it is not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Ms MARIA AROZ
How has modern technology changing our daily lives ?
Modern technology has changed a lot our daily lives .
On one hand nowadays if we had to travel to Paris and return to the same day you can take a plane without any problem .
In the past it was impossible to go to Paris to Barcelona and come back in one day .
Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone , if you get lost somebody could find you .
I think that the most important modern technology in these days is internet .
With internet you can do whatever you want without going out home ( shops , speaking to a friend , work , putting your money aside .... )
On the other hand the main disadvantage is that using modern machines it can be very difficult for elderly people ; it would be very profitable if the modern industry train people in using modern technology .
To sum up modern technology has changed a lot our daily lives and this is going to increase .
Dear Mr Robertson !
I 'm writing to you to thank you for good programme of our English classes in London , especially for river trip in Greenwich , it will be a great experience for us .
But the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Leisure Show " which'll take place in Central Exhibition Hall , London , on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 and at the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show .
It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions , make up , hairstyles and we can speak English people and make new friends .
There is one more advantage : it is free for students .
So we would like to suggest you how the programme could be changed .
First of all on Tuesday we all will go to the show and spend there all our day , but on Wednesday in the afternoon when we have free time we can go to the Science Museum if you do n't mind , of course .
Please let us know , as soon as you make your decision .
With best wishes , your students .
Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie
Dear Lucas !
Thank you very much for your letter , I was glad to get it and know a lot of news to you .
First of all I want to congratulate your cousin in fifteenth birthday and with all the best .
I hope that it will be good holiday for her , her family and friends .
Now about your question , it is very difficult for me to give any advice you about it , I do n't know your cousin very well so I do n't know what she prefers reading .
But when I was fifteen my favourite book " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " .
So I can recommend you to present this book , because it is very interesting , amusing , sometimes dramatic and mystery books .
This book helps us to improve our logic , mind , memory and it teaches the reader not to lie , be more honest with other people and pay attention to the small details of our lives because sometimes it can help us very very much .
So I hoped I could help you .
Write me as soon as you can .
With best wishes , your
Dear Helen Ryan
I have just received your letter , and thank you very much for your reply .
I am very happy to take part in the competition and I would like to give you all the information you need :
First of all , I am available for travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during this month .
Secondly , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
Although it is not very comfortable , I like camping very much .
Thirdly , I was very interested in swimming and also climbed .
I took up climbing five years ago and I was very keen on .
I am very good at swimming as well because I practised this sport every week in my city .
Finally , could you tell me what I need to dress and also how much money I would spend on .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
I have asked to write a composition regarding the questioning is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable .
In fact , to do shopping can be some advantages for different reasons :
Firstly , you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time put on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size .
Secondly , it is easy to spend a lot of money with few minutes and as soon as you can regret to buy all these clothes , which you do n't really need .
Thirdly , some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying , so you have to go back to the shop .
However , it is not easy to get a refund or to change them .
In my opinion , doing shopping brought me a lot of satisfaction especially I was depressed , nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 'm writing to complain about the service you 'd offered me last Saturday evening at the Circle Theatre .
I 've read your advertisement and it did n't say the truth .
There were n't any discounts available as you 'd assured for the added .
I think you should check the information before printing it !
I arrived at the right time ( 19.30 ) that evening but the play , which was ' Over the Rainbow ' , started almost an hour later .
And nobody told me why !
When the play began I realised that the main actor had been changed and a new one was n't good at all .
I could n't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for reparations .
Why did n't you say something about it ?
I did n't have the ' perfect evening out ' you 'd promised so
I want to ask for my money back because your service is terrible .
Please answer my letter as soon as possible .
I 'll be looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Marcella , Scalia C.
'
How have Modern Technology Changed My Daily Life ? '
This is not a simple question because I got used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I 'm going to try to explain you how .
I did n't have the computer until I was eight .
Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability .
In that time I used a computer only to play at its video games .
When I was thirteen I discover a completely different use from my computer .
It became science to do my homework .
And years later it enabled me to get a very good job .
One day my mother got a terrible disease .
She had to be operated on and my family and I was very scared .
But when we talked to the doctor we feel more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one .
I think that if my mother had gotten ill ten years before , she would n't survive .
The modern technology is better now than what it used to be .
What do you think about this ?
I 'm sure that these arguments have explained my point of view , haven't they ?
Now I would like to have your point of view .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
I 'm writing you in response to your letter , I am delighted to know that I won the first price .
With reference to the date , I only can go in July , as I 'm going off on holiday in August , and I start university in September .
The place I 'd prefer to stay is a log cabin , where I 'm sure I 'd feel more comfortable than a tent .
It 's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activity .
The ones I 'm most keen on being tennis , in which I think I 'm pretty good since I took some classes last year , and painting , which is one of my favourite hobbies , and helps me to relax myself and forget about problems .
I think I 'm not bad for painting either , at least everyone in my family like my work , including myself .
Anyway , there are some questions I 'd like to ask you : What kind of clothes would be the most suitable for California weather in summer , and how much money do you think I 'll need ?
I 'm waiting forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Mandela B.
Dear Kim ,
I 'm so sorry I haven't written until now , but you know I 'm always very busy .
As I told you in my last letters , last month I worked for a pop band , and helped them to a concert in Barcelona .
It was such a great experience !
Basically my work was carrying the instruments , the speakers and the light from the van to the stage , which is not an easy work because , as you can imagine , it 's not exactly light stuff .
But the most exciting part was meeting the band , mainly the singer and the drummer who was very nice and also good - look .
Anyway , I had lots of fun working for them .
I hope they call me soon , I 'd be the happiest girl in the world if I could see them again ...
I 'd better leave now .
I hope you write again soon .
Mandela B.
Dear Madam
I am very happy to win this prize and I am going to give you some information about me that you need to make me having a good time at Camp California .
I would like to know only in July because I had set my holidays this month since last January .
I want if it was possible a log cabin like accommodation because I have been suffering from my back since my childhood , therefore I need a comfortable accommodation .
I would be pleased to swim and paint when I am in the camp .
I selected swimming because it is a cure against my backache and I had not practiced since I started my new job five years ago .
I also chose painting because I have never done before , I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a calming activity .
Otherwise , could you tell me approximately how much money I have to take on the food , please ?
Yours sincerely .

How many times have we heard people complain about shopping ?
Sometimes , they were happy to do shopping .
But why ?
Therefore , shopping can be enjoyable but it is not always the case .
Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer some thing for someone .
In fact you try to get a present to make received happy .
Shopping is also good , when you know what you want .
For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sports shop
But if you do n't knows what you want you are going to waste your time in the shop .
In the opposite , shopping can be enjoyable .
Shopping is boring if you go to people too fussy .
That is to say , they are never happy with what they got and see .
They always find the problem .
Shopping is not enjoyable for people who just look around the shops .
It was stupid , they do not have any goals .
They wasted their time .
To conclude , I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable .
Even if I like to do shopping for some people and kind of shops I will kill myself because I wasted my time .
To the managers of the
Circle Theatre in London
I 'm a tourist and I had a week 's holiday in London a few time ago .
I have enjoyed to see the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some nights ago ; and the actor 's Danny Brook performance .
I went to the theatre at 19.30 o'clock but , to my surprise , the show started at 20:15 and so I could n't remain here until the end because I left London , with my group before the end of the show .
The star , the actor Danny Brook , there was n't in the musical show but there was an other actor , to my great disappointed .
Then , in a program I could read the discounts available for the tickets , with the group , but I could n't have that .
I could n't have all the things I expected .
That evening was terrible for me and for my friends , so I 'm not satisfied with your information and I ask some money back .
I hope for your answer and with your explanation for this .
Your Sincerely
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Some days ago , when the school was ending , Pat and her friends decided to make a party at their friend , Frances , because the end of the school and the Francis 's birthday is the same day .
That might be a secret for Francis - and they decided the program and the present , a new gold watch .
Peter and Sue asked to Francis some help with their exam 's subjects and Francis , to help them , was very busy all week .
The last day all the friends went to Pat 's home with food , musical instruments , tape recorder .
Pat is very excited about this .
In the afternoon she had phoned for the Francis 's mother and she explained her secret ,
Then she phoned in her best friend and she spoke about that too ; she phoned to many people all day .
Now many people knew the secret but Pat said everyone : " I tell you a small secret , but you do n't speak , please ! "
In the night Francis was invited to the party , with Pat 's home .
When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner , his friend , asked him if he was very happy about his present , the new gold watch , he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends .
The Francis 's secret was discovered !
Now all the Pat 's friend do n't told her about their secret because Pat is n't very good at keeping secrets .
