# System Output

This directory contains the system output for all the results reported in the main paper.  

Specifically, conll2013, fce-dev and jfleg-dev all contain the output from the threshold experiments used to make Figure 1, while conll2014, fce-test and jfleg-test are the results using the optimum thresholds as reported in Table 3.   

All system output has also been annotated with ERRANT to convert it into M2 format with annotated error types.
