In modern digital world , electronic products are widely used in daily life such as smart phones , computers and etc .
In work places , electronic devices such as computers is also inevitable for used to increase the productivity of the corporation .
The convenience and high efficiency by using electronic products is being noticed by people worldwide .
Some people start to think if electronic products could be further operating with more advanced utilization and replace human beings to better performance .
Surveillance technologies such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is one type of examples that have currently being implemented .
In this essay , I will discuss that if surveillance technologies such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) should be used or not to track people .
Personally , I agreed to a large extent that surveillance technologies such as RFID should be used to track people .
Surveillance technologies such as RFID can be operated twenty-four hours in the absence of operators to track does every detail of human activity .
For instance , in military which is of high importance , surveillance technology is essential as it is a way to provide undeniable evidence if anything is fault .
In supermarkets where it is difficult to catch steamers , surveillance technology which make records that can be replayed or detect stolen from the spot is superior to use .
The high accuracy by utilizing surveillance technology eliminates the amount of disagreement among people .
If people are aware of the existence of surveillance , a chance for them to follow rules and order is high .
It is useful as it reduces the chances of wrong doing that might occur .
Therefore , surveillance technologies make our society more orders .
Risks could be analyzed if there is a record of what was happening in the past .
In late nineteenth century , there was a severe air crash happened at Miami international airport .
The air cargo of a Valujet plane was on fire after the plane had taken off .
Sooner or later , the electric system is short circuit as a result that the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground at extremely high speeds .
All passengers and pilots are dying .
After finding and analyzing the black boxes of a Valujet after the incidence , police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence .
Surveillance technologies can be used to detect very risky events and prevent its happening in the future , hence to save more lives .
In addition , if surveillance technology is even better develops , it can be used to detect the problem before the real accidence has happened .
However , the dark side of using surveillance technology is that it results in an invasion of privacy .
People under supervision is under high pressure to perform naturally .
People are less likely to enjoy life under surveillance .
Therefore , surveillance technology providing convenience to the society but made more inconvenience for individuals .
Therefore , surveillance technologies could be used but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected by normal life .
In general , surveillance technology benefits the society and should be applied to the consideration of individuals ' lives .
I do not agree with this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
In this fast moving society , technology is always improved to catch up the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology being used by the police or other army usage to track people down .
Although the surveillance technology is an issue of invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
There are two pointed supports this argument .
Firstly , security systems are improving in many areas such as school campuses or in the workplace .
Secondly , it makes it possible for parents to track their children and also their elderly parents .
Therefore , this technology should be used to track people .
Many in this surveillance is being implemented in the government sector , military areas to enhance their security .
It can also be found in schools and workplaces .
It is useful to the government and the people of the law sector .
They can maintain social control and recognize threats .
Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen .
In addition , it could provide all day surveillance around the school or office with little manpower needs .
For example , intruders can be detected if there was any school or office .
This can protect the students for being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who were studying at nursery .
In addition , it can also prevent theft .
This technology could also be a helpful tool to assist law enforcers such as the police to collect evidence at crime after it occurred .
This could increase the efficiency of solving a crime and thus decrease the amount of criminal acts or people .
With the help of a video surveillance , the chances of people performing crime can be decreased .
However , video surveillance may be a help in most sectors , it can also be misused by many people .
Some may use it to peek or recording something illegal .
For example , it could be installed on personal locker with record other 's moves and action .
This technology could also be seen as invasion of human 's privacy .
Surveillance technologies could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched .
This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
If everyone is being watched unknowingly , it seems that our freedom of doing things are being invaded .
Technology can be a very useful tool if being used in the correct manner .
It may be a help to prevent potential crime from happening but also help people do crime .
The knowledge of installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes can be eliminated instead of increasing it .
The more people use it over us , the more power they will have for us .
We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placing or implants to anyone .
We do not want to be sued infringe other 's privacy , therefore , before implanting any RFID , we should ask about other 's consent .
Surveillance technology is getting more and more widely used in the development of modern technology in terms of various scientific breakthroughs .
And after all this scientific research results were applied to daily life , products such as RFID tracking system has become real .
RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purposes , it was also used to track people for doing human implant .
It is unacceptable for some people in society , however , I think this application is necessary and provided the society a lot of benefits .
Surveillance technologies such as RFID has been used to track people may help to reduce the number of people who get lost .
For example , there is always news of newspaper , reported that some elderly get lost in certain places and their families are looking for him or her .
The family members must be worrying a lot of the lost elderly , and with the help of police office , maybe they can find an elderly back , but it will take a long time , and a lot of energy to find someone in the country has a population of five million without knowing the exact location of that person .
However , if the elderly have been implanted with RFID devices , then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her to a special serial numbers issued by each device differently .
They can track the location of the device on the information provided by the RFID signals ; therefore find the location of the lost elderly in a short period of time .
Surveillance technologies such as RFID is not only useful in tracking the lost people but also useful to prevent the trading of children which happens in many developing countries .
It may be know that young children may be stolen by some agency that did the business to trade the children .
For example , they may wait in a public area and waiting for parents to bring their children out but do n't paid attention to the child , so that this kind of agency may bring a child in mountain areas and sell him or her at a good price .
Since this is happening more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for parents to find the child back without knowing where the child had been brought in .
Since this might happen across provinces , and without any clues about the path that a child may go through .
However , if a child had been installed by tracking devices , more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back .
Not only the details of locations will be provided , but also might lead to find out the root of this kind of child trade agency and it helped to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen to any family .
Surveillance technologies will help to prevent a family from losses their members especially the elderly and the children which need to be paying more attention to .
As the technology increasingly advanced , many things that are regarded as impossible is turned into a 'possibles' .
From internet , email from the most powerful surveillance technology , every step was advancement of not only the society but also the world 's achievements .
People 's lives became increasingly convenient for almost luxury , thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available on the man 's life .
However , such rapid advancement technology though can be extremely useful in our daily lives ; it could also cause an invisible or massive threat to our peaceful living that can be out of our imaginations and estimation .
Today , the surveillance technology has become almost manifested in wherever we go .
Take Singapore for example , these are installed in highly secured places such as government sectors to work places , from condominiums to housing developments boarding house , and even in school canteens in toilet !
Even our application for our phones or other smartphones , our I-pad can easily revealed our location .
Every move for us is being closely surveilled and follow once we stepped out at home .
Now , surveillance technologies such as RFID is even invented to track people .
I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public and take for granted .
On the other hand , I would also discuss the RFID should be utilized for good purposes .
I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public with easy abused and distorted usage .
First , our privacy is at threat .
Though tracking devices such as the application of our smartphones these days can add fun and entertainment to our fast-living pace lives , this can be a double-edged sword .
We reveal our location , with our friends to catch up with us , however we can never know who is watching us out there secretly .
Hackers became increasingly vicious , invaded into our computer system , now of radio-frequency tracking devices , this might fall into inappropriate hands for the wrong reasons .
Every move for us is easily tracked .
This is very hazardous .
No matter how good and how many security systems are there with us , the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and break the code of the security system .
On the other hand , I think RFID can be useful when comes to appropriate handling and usage .
For example , this could be very beneficial and useful device for police forces to track crime suspects and terrorists in their movements , or contribute to more leading to solve the case .
Additionally , if appropriately used , this device could contributed to our scientific findings and research .
In this , I mean that we can input this device implanted into an animal or bird species , for us to track their movement and actions related to our human research that could bring us to the new regime .
RFID is indeed a great invention .
It could benefit our mankind if appropriately used .
However , I think such powerful devices should not be made easily available to the public or fall into the hands of 'ill-intentioned ' individual .
This will lead to more crime and bring threats of our privacy .
RFID is used in many forms for example , transportation , home and even office .
Over these years , it has helped humans to improve the accessibility of the form of cards to gain access to certain places .
Other than using it in these areas , it is also being used as human implant or as a form of product .
These implants and products are also being used as surveillance tools .
For used as a surveillance tool , it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics .
There are also medical tools that are more with implanted into the human body for basic medical research .
Moreover , the use of RFID chip tracking clothes were also very common sights in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and track the location of it at any one point .
When raid have been used for the transportation needs in the form of ez-link card , the ability to gain faster and easier access to the transportation needs have been seen over the years .
This also could be used as a tracking device where the place a person visits in the past few trips are all records in the system and a card .
This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing for society as it could be used to fight crime to maintain law and order .
As this information was being well kept by the operator where they encrypt the data and using it to the proper form .
This also prevents the chance of normal hackers to get this information that was recorded in proper usage is misused by unlawful usage .
Moreover , the use of RFID in medical research was also being widely used in many countries .
These chips are also implanted under the human skin where it also helps to store the basic information about the people in it .
This form of tools do not harm but it helps with the ability to identify any person who was not carrying any identification when comes to emergencies .
This important information may be needed to save a persons life where their medical history are all recorded on a chip .
Additionally , the service industry is also using it to track its clothes that are being used for their employees .
This is a scene seen for Resort World Sentosa .
The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chips for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes are for .
As their clothes are massing collected and washed with an external company , the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helped in terms of the logistical hassles .
Therefore , the usage of RFID chips is more useful to help the humans in the basic needs or task that is required .
This form of tracking was also not harmful to any person where they much of these information were all used by helping a person then disrupting the lives of human race .
Therefore I agree that the use of RFID technology for tracking any person or product that would help the human race which also was mentioned above .
I think that surveillance technologies such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) can be used to track people .
Nowadays , with the rapid development of science and technology , an emerging technology always contributed to human being better living conditions .
For example , the internet has abridging the distances among people globally .
Although we have to admit some bad effects which was brought up on the new technology , still an advantage in the new technology could not be simply discarded .
Back in the surveillance technology , people might say it leaking their privacy or personal life .
Compared with this disadvantage , we should think about what an advantage it has made available for human beings .
It can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment .
Tracking people using surveillance technology could make better security in people 's lives .
For the old people , if they are alone at home , one day , they wanted to go out for a walk .
In case , they have some accidents like heart attacks , a track of them would show there was something wrong .
The people can get there as soon as possible to save them .
For young people , parents do not need to worry about where my kids will go after the school .
By investigating the tracks of the surveillance technology , they can easily figure out where is their kids now and know roughly what they are doing .
On the other hand , due to the track to people , the police can better knowing a person 's daily schedule .
It gave the police a better control of the criminal .
All these contributions from using the surveillance technology to track makes the environment safer .
Tracking people using surveillance technology could make people 's lives more convenient and identifiable .
Nowadays , people need to carry a lot of ID cards around to show that I am the one the same as the one on the ID card .
If we have these technologies , it will automatically confirm people 's indemnification and saves the effort to carry a lot of cards .
Once people have their own identity confirmed , they can even need not to bring any money along with them .
To purchase goods , they just need to deduce money with their identity and make the transition to money for the one who is selling the goods .
Based on an identifiable environment , a lot of conventions way or style of human life can be changed .
For the privacy concerns , if the technology can be made to adjust to human being 's feelings , it would be more welcome .
For example , if the ones who carried an identifiable sensor does not want any others to know his or her location , he or she can disable the track .
Then , you might ask , how can the police get the information ?
I think that the tracks can be saved from some place which is not open to public .
Once it is very severe , the records will be popping out for official use .
As you can see , there are quite a lot of advantages of using surveillance technology to track people .
In short , it could provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment for human beings .
Besides , we can try to reducing the bad effects caused by new technology .
Thus , I strongly agree that surveillance technologies such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) can be used to track people .
I do not agree with the above statement .
In my opinion , surveillance technologies such as RFID should be used to track people though there does exist many problems if it prevails .
This could help to regulate people 's behavior , control crime and prevent terrorism , and setting up demographic data .
RFID , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringements , are different from video surveillance .
Unlike video surveillance , riding can only reflect the location and movement of the people of tags .
Without sent back any images or sound recordings , RFID was more user-friendly and help prevent user 's privacy in the best it can .
Firstly , RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior .
The tags can be used for those who need to be taken care or the beloved one , such as a child whose parents were always concerned about his whereabouts when parents were not together for him , or maybe a lovely dogs whose owners fear of losing her .
In the first case , RFID can be used to help parents of surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are to school or play around with his friends ' homes , and this may help parents regulate their children 's behaviour .
Secondly , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism .
Everyday crimes were happening from time to time , and helping to keep low criminal rates could be a combo of ethical , physiological and social problems .
RFID could be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminals or terroristic thought .
Police could put tags on those that have potential intention to commit crimes .
Thus , when a man with a 'terrorism tag ' entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observed the man 's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from exploding TNT .
Apart from preventing crime and terrorism , RFID could also be used as the evidence or alibis to help infer whether the suspect was a criminal or not .
What is more , RFID can be used to help collect demographic data .
If RFID being used by everyone and run for years , surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistics data show the movement of people from city to city , from town to town , which city is expanding more than people think , which city is becoming less attractive .
Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs of each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructure , what kind of infrastructure and what other developments should be made .
Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend by locals as well as the whole country .
As for transportation , road and traffic authorities can easily identify where traffic jams are and advised drivers to change to suggest routes .
In all , RFID should be applied to facilitate governors to better manage the world that we are living .
It can help regulate behaviour , preventing crime and set up demographic data bases for various uses .
But before an application , governments need to secure safety for riding after implantation and making sure there will not be any ID theft .
More importantly , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information .
As technology becomes more advanced nowadays , people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily lives .
It is undeniable that technology has made ours lives and work easier and more efficient .
However , when surveillance technology started to violet the privacy of people instead of being used by the more beneficial way towards people , it is my opinion , that , such technologies should rethink its way of existence .
In fact , people are getting more exposed to public through the fast development of a virtual world-the internet .
Social networks such as Facebook ,Tiwtter and many others often reveal the true identity and some confidential information about users without being realised .
This already raised up a problem in privacy leakage .
The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem of stalking on people 's privacy openly which might arouse anger and unhappiness among people .
Such incidents happen in London a few years ago , when the government installed CCTV ( ) on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order .
This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allows fast search for people who violate the law and cause harm to others .
Instead , when news of the installments of such devices were released to the newspaper , it was heavily criticised by the public .
People were claiming the lost of privacy .
Government has to uninstall all the devices at the end .
From this case , we can clearly concluded that surveillance technology might be helpful in some way , however , when it touched the privacy of people themselves , it is unacceptable .
From the point of humanity , it was inhumane to use such technology for human beings .
We often put tags on products and animals because we treat them as good , it was easy to trade when they are all labelled and tags .
However , human beings are not animals or any other product , they have their own thoughts and freedom .
They have full control of their own lives .
If so , then why do we need human implant to trace their activities and lives when they are free to do things that they like .
It is understandable that once people have human implanted , they may start to behave themselves because they could be easily traced out .
However , this way of curbing the crimes were so violent that will only cause people to rebel and think about ways to escape the tracking of such devices .
After all there would be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality .
Humanity can be best seen in the cases of pet rearing .
Pets are supposed to be chained when they were out on the streets .
However , in countries like China , where there is no law to force people to chain their pets , pets are usually left unchained and run freely in the streets .
It may be dangerous as some pets are rather fierce and aggressive , however , it is the benevolence nature of human beings that we treat pets as " human beings " , our friends that we do not want to restrict their freedoms .
This phenomenon is accepted by the public even to those who do not own a pet .
This shows that even though there is a risk of causing harm to someone , people still prefer to bear the risks and allowing their pets to have maximum freedoms .
Even pets are granted to freedom , people themselves certainly treats freedom as something essential .
In conclusion , I think that surveillance technologies should not be allowed to be used to track people .
It does not only restricts their freedom in all aspects , but also causes leakage of personal information .
This greatly violet the rights of people .
Technology advancement is extremely fast nowadays .
Surveillance technology is one of the main concerns in military and national defense sector .
Examples of this technology is RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implant or RFID tags on people .
However , this proposal has led to fierce arguments about the world over its pros and cons .
I personally stand together to the population who rejected the proposal .
First of all , everyone in the world belongs to themselves who did not belong to anyone from my personal perspective .
Human rights are raised up pretty frequently on the world over the past few years .
Approval of RFID tracking would be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedoms .
Would not it similar to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space ?
Secondly , the tracking proposal would raise the safety issues .
The chip identifiers technologies can be reproduced by anyone .
It represents a query : is not everyone can view each other 's information such as name and age ?
The leakage of these confidential information can be a sensitive issue for personal , violation of freedom and breakdown in safety .
One of the examples are the storage of bank account number to a tracking chip .
Criminals could identify it easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if a tracking proposal was approved .
He or she could easily touch to a designated bank accounts since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers .
Other than that , safety issues can be extended to personal safety .
Everyone knows the internet and data transmissions are very common and accessible at any time and point such as Facebook .
However , people tend to express their personal feelings and ideas about sensitive issues on the internet unintentionally .
This action could actually generating aggressive feelings from others and violent movements could be launched onto the one with the aid of tracking tags or implanted .
Internet can be a convenient source to achieve the names and basic information about personal if it were hacked and the tracking proposal will facilitate the findings of designating people .
In addition , the national defense would be endangered if this tracking proposal was launched .
The technology is based on a chip implant or tag .
However , the chip implants can be retrieved out easily and replant onto other people and so on the tag .
Mischief case could actually cause the chaos at the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it ill-intentionally .
For example , the wanted person can escape out easily in the country and hide in another country by this method .
This track proposal created a loophole on the net for justice rather than its original purpose .
In a nutshell , surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience if being used appropriately .
However , it is fairly fragile which can be counter-used of criminals from current levels .
I would stand against the idea of tracking individual given its vulnerability to technology at present .
Nowadays , the improving human technology online is able to track different locations with different people .
For instance , face book as a well known social media platform has the ability to track someone 's location .
However , with some opinion , these auto-tracking service breaks the rules on privacy .
Some people do not want to be tracked as they feel it is not safe .
In my opinion , the developed surveillance technology could be used to track people and objects only if the track people agree to receive this service .
There exists various advantages to using the surveillance technology .
The first example will be to track your personal items and prevent about losing it .
We all know that there is an application for iPhone calls where are my phone .
It basically serves to allocate your phone 's position with any single time , for instance , if someone leaves his phone to a certain place , he can check his phone 's location by searching through the internet use another phone that has the same application if you are connected to your friends ' devices .
You are able to find the location of your lost iPhone on asking your friends as all the shared devices are able to see the location of each other .
Another good example of using tracking technology will be to find a way to a place that someone had never been there before .
For example , one person wanted to visit his friends placed in a new city .
His friend was able to upload his location due to this advanced technology .
Then , the person is able to use GPS or other auto-tracking device to find a place even he had never gone in there before .
The radio-frequency devices can be used in old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well .
For instance , when people get old , they began to loss their memories and sometimes they may not remember their way to homes or other places .
If the old people always bring a auto-tracking device , it is much easier for young people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people .
Although the auto-tracking device is quite powerful , it still has to be used for volunteer base .
Without an agreement , people should not able to use this technology to track others .
For example , if the tracking technology is able to track everyone even stranger , this means your location at anytime is viewable in every single person online .
These kind of situation would cause crime as thieves may auto tracks you and you are not able to run out of them .
Therefore , we must agree to the statement before the technology is able to track us .
At the same time , our location should be protected by seen by strangers .
All the conditions must be agreed by the people that agree auto-tracking devices to track him like , a time of tracking and who can view your location .
In conclusion , the advanced technology gives people convenience to find their items and their safety .
At the same time , people must protect their privacy without sharing their place with strangers .
Overall , the benefits of these technologies overweight its problems occur if people use it wisely .
The increase in population in the country made the government takes more difficulties in registering the members of each individual families and hence other factors existed as an obstacle to country development .
By following the trend of improvement in technology , people can now easily tracked by using RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) by simply implanting an RFID tag on human bodies .
With this advantage , it would be easier for people to locate his friends or his family when they lost contact or by an urgent and also by police to investigate crimes .
By taking an example to any country , there are crimes everyday and it was obvious to see that not all the culprits have been arrested and were punished .
There were kidnapped everywhere and not all of the family could afford the ransom that acquired by kidnappers .
In that case , they would have no choice but to seek the power to loyal police .
The detectives will start investigating the first criminal scenes and brainstorm with all the possibilities .
Reality killing people in mind .
There are only 10 % of all the time by successfully pinpointed the kidnappers dens and arrested all of them before they started to harm the poor victim .
In that sense , without the proper way to track human beings , it is way too difficult to save those innocent lives .
Also , not only the kidnappers and the victims need to be tracked down , but also jailbreak .
Few years ago , there was a jailbreak named Mat Selamat , one of the members of the terrorist from Obama , successfully escaped under the monitoring of a couple of cops in Singapore .
That is a rare case since Singapore is actually an absolutely safe country .
According to news , a police force has mobilized thousands of cops , each of them preparing for duty and patrols of the allocated places all over the country and after few months , none of them were able to find Mat Selamat and rearrested him .
People falling into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government has no choice but keep claiming that their country is still about safety mode .
If RFID came into existence , this kind of case can be totally avoided in no time .
Beside , if RFID is supposed to be used by the public , everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dear family .
Nowadays , people using the all-purpose smart phones for communicating .
With the power of internet , there is nothing impossible to find a friend for afternoon tea .
In spite of that , smart phone is still a device that need to be recharging its battery or else it will be just like the rigid objects .
Imagine when people camped in forests or hills , they would just lost all of the internet signal and also the risk that their phones runs out of batteries .
In that case , if they get lost or losing contact , they would be considered as a lost and eventually , they will not survive .
With the help of RFID , if there is an urgent that people crying for help , they would be saved .
In conclusion , RFID benefit people more than bring harmful side effects to human body in considering to human safety .
Nowadays , technology was more advanced than the past time .
In the past , people only can find each other and communicate face to face .
After the invention of phone and internet , there are more ways to use to communicate with people and even tracking people .
In this means time , surveillance technology is found which means that we are able to track people for every time from everywhere .
Definitely , there are points of view that agreed the technology but also the voices of objection .
Thus , let 's us discussed the pros and cons now to give you a clear mind of surveillance technology .
Initially , surveillance technologies such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is implanted into the body of animals .
It functions to track the path of animals and help in scientific research .
Besides that , many animals which just being released in the protection of humans for a long time been implanting an RFID as well to track their new life in ensuring whether they could survive in the wild life .
This technology is encouraged by some of the public that by implanting an RFID into prisoners ' bodies .
The initial function was good indeed that to track the movements of them to protect the public safety and interests if they are out of prison .
However , some of the non-governmental organizations showed their points of view that objects and resist implanting an RFID into prisoners ' bodies .
Their opinions is founded on the basic human rights .
Prisoners ' privacy are endangered due to the RFID .
After they released from the prison , the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government .
They feel stressful under the control of government and it might lead to the way that we do not desire and imagine .
Furthermore , some parents hold positive views of surveillance technology and agree to implanting an RFID into their child 's body .
Their opinion was based on a child safety protection and parents ' guardian .
Children can be easily found if they are lost or abducted by other people .
However , there are both sides of story .
This technology led to a problem which is same with the prisoner issue that is the human privacy .
Children are giving birth to their parents ; parents are responsible to take good care of them .
Although the initial functioning of implementation of RFID is good for the child , however children also have a human rights and privacy which is endanger under this technology .
Besides tags into human bodies , there is also the issue of implanted into products .
Recently , many with cell phones being equipped with GPS which means that they can find the device 's location if it is lost .
It is also an advance of surveillance technology .
Children can easily be tracked based on the location of cell phones for parents .
Compared with the human implant , tags on the product is better and more suitable .
Under the product tags , children are given the significant free space as compared to the congested controlled by human implant .
Parents also can ensure the safety of children as well as did not endanger their privacy .
It is the way that could " using one stone to kill two birds " .
In conclusion , based on the advantages and disadvantages discussed , I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
However , to a certain extent , I agree with implanting RFID tags on products to protect the safety of children .
As world pace becomes faster and faster , the need for maximum efficiency becoming stronger and stronger in every field .
To know where a certain item located became one of the ways to improve efficiency .
For example , UPS could track the process for each delivery .
With the information about the location of the cargo , it was much easier to prevent unexpected losses and came up with more efficient plan to save the energy and resources of the company .
RFID is one of the advanced technology for tracking .
Due to the small size of the equipment and an energy-saving features , it becomes more and more popular with industry and logistics .
However , it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people in human implant or RFID tags on daily products like watches or clothing , it does provide convenience in a certain situation .
The big difference between humans and animals or any other object is that we have self-esteem or we need a basic respect to our peers .
One of the basic rights of human is a right to privacy .
In any period of time , as long as we do not offensive others , we should enjoy the right to privacy .
However , the idea of using RFID to track people violating our need for privacy .
Since RFID tags attached to the product could remain functional for a long period of time , it could be misused for surveillance purposes which are not related to the industry production or supply activities .
For example , a consumer buys a product of RFID in the supermarket .
As an RFID is embedded within the product , people who had access to the information definitely could track him .
However , the consumer may not be aware of the functions of the tag , so this action could reveal sensitive information about a consumer like home address , work address of someone who is not authorized to get the information .
If this piece of information was misused , chances are high that the consumer would suffer losses like financial losses or even cause danger to the life of the consumer .
Moreover , if a product is what one needs to use every day like clothing or shoes , then the location of one will be revealed every second .
This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you .
It is not only scary but also illegal .
Although someone would say the information is secure very well and would not be released or misused for any purpose , it was still not appropriate .
We can think about this scenario : the location of us going about daily life will be sent to a computer to be processed and stored every second .
Does this sounds reasonable to you ?
As what we have mentioned above , as human beings , we should enjoy our privacy during our lives as long as we do not cause harm to others .
However , RFID will violate our right to privacy during our shopping activity .
Therefore , RFID should not be used to track people no matter through human implant or tags on products .
Does a society need surveillance or not ?
With the developed in modern society , more and more new technology appears and people 's life quality rose because of the new inventions .
Some good examples such as the internet , computers and satellites are now quite common in humans ' normal life ; however , some problems also emerged , with concerns about the loss of the privacy of civilians .
In a modern society privacy is a hot topic in peoples ' minds .
Even if the safety is the most important thing to consider in normal life , many people still want to keep their privacy in spite of existing some potential danger .
The contradictions of a safety and privacy could not be reconciled perfectly .
With an installed in the surveillance of every corner of Singapore , people 's life has a safe securities , and criminals are deterred by these electrical instruments .
A report showed that the crime rate in Singapore is the lowest in the world .
This is because of two reasons , one being the strictest laws in Singapore , and the other is a dense surveillance everywhere .
During the year 2003 , surveillance strategies help Singapore beat the SARS and successfully prevent the spreading of the epidemic situation .
At that time , Singapore government adopted the method to install surveillance of every patient 's home to look after their actions .
Much media had reported the effective measures on installing surveillance in Singapore .
Without the using of the surveillance , the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly , and the losses caused by SARS may be many times than that of 2003 in Singapore .
The benefits of the surveillance is obvious from the fighting with SARS , and this is a success examples of the surveillance .
Every coin has its two sides .
In one way the surveillance helped government guards civilians ' property and lives , by the other way the surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable under the 24 hour ' monitoring .
In a novel 1984 , written by George Orwell , author imagines a world in which people are being watched by the big brother when they do everything .
Every word people said could be heard from the government and because of that , government knows well on everyone 's mind and want to wash everyone 's mind and control normal people totally .
It is a country without any freedom and democracy in the novel .
In reality , people are afraid of being tracked everywhere , not because of meaning in crime , but the spirit of freedom and privacy is in everyone 's hearts .
When the husband is talking a sweet sentence of his wife , none of the couples wanted it to be heard by the people behind the monitor .
Normal people 's privacy needs governments seriously considered .
People need a safe environment to live in , and also need a private environment to stay independent .
The surveillance was a useful method to keep society 's safe , but also kill the privacy of people to some degree .
The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life , and then the surveillance are no more need .
At that time , even if there were no surveillance above people 's heads , there is surveillance in everyone 's hearts and criminals are more difficult to hide .
Nowadays , humans live in a modern society .
Around people , there are full of high technology like CVS , automatically sorting system for good and different information systems .
In order to bring more benefits and ensure people 's safety , surveillance technology has been utilized in many aspects of fields like UPS and DHL , these express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods .
It is convenient for customs to track and confirm where and how their goods are now .
However , besides tracking goods for people , people began to use this technology to track people .
I do not agree this kind of behavior , because humans are different for good , could not treat humans as good .
There is no doubt , tracking system has brought many benefits to this information age .
No matter where people go , taking buses or art , people were under the CCTV , it is very important and useful to track and find people .
Actually , tracking system has provided people safety indemnification .
However , track people is difficult and different for good .
For instance , the company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore , and is currently keeping track of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system-a system which could be open to abuse such as an employee punched a card to another .
Goods are dead , but humans are alive .
If one company really use this technology to track their employees , employees would dislike and claim that their humans ' rights and privacy has been violated .
In another words , people will feel that the boss or the company treated them like good , because modern people need more homage not money .
So , when employees began to conflict with this tracking system , they would find some way to escape a tracking system like asking friends to help them to punch cards .
Finally , the company tracking system has no meaning at all , therefore tracking system was very terrible measures to control people .
In addition , tracking people system might be used by bad people in the wrong way .
How to explain this problem , it means that people are not sure who was in charge of these tracking system .
For example , people going somewhere , no matter took buses , MR or driving , they are under the CCTV .
If some bad people wanted to track someone about their personal purposes , by hackers technology , they can use government tracking system to do their own businesses .
In other words , government originally hoped to use tracking systems to ensure citizen safety , now it had been divulged human information .
It is very dangerous to society , because people do not know who is tracking them , it must bring citizen trepidation .
In conclusion , what I have mentioned above , we had to agree , tracking system has many benefits for different parts of human life especially in this modern world .
But tracking people was very terrible choice , it sounded like people invented the 'prison ' in jail themselves , people need homage and freedom .
Also tracking people are very dangerous if it has been controlled by bad men in the not good purpose .
So surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Surveillance technologies : A prospering technology
Radio-frequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless non-contact system to scan and transfer the data to a tag attached to people or products from radio-frequency electromagnetic fields .
After this , it can automatically get an identification and tracking .
Nowadays , this technology has been used in many kinds of fields , such as transportation and logistics , transportation payment , product tracking and inventory systems , some institutions and so on .
More interestingly , this technology is being used in human identification , even planting the chip into human bodies .
This fact became very controversial among people and the possibility of personal information released without knowing also brought the public 's concerns .
In some fields , surveillance technology does have brought us tremendous benefit and advantage .
Logistics and transportation are major areas of utilization of RFID technology .
In the transportation , almost all of the people have transport cards with daily transport .
Since we do not bring cash to pay for the transportation fees , enormous time has been saved from everybody .
For a society , there will be a more efficient transportation system .
For the logistics , if all the products are attached to the tag , it is much easier to count and record all the products .
This would make the logistics process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of products losing because of the tracking .
Since the inventory management is very important for some kind of company , this technology is playing a very significant role .
The super markets are also using this technology to tag their products , which can record the condition of all of the products on time and prevent stealing .
When checking out , the price tag will be scanned to get the total payment very quickly .
This will save customers time and also improve the profit on the market .
The library also used this technology to identify the membership of the people enter , which ensures the security and the member itself would also conserve their information made in this library .
Both the library and museum applying this technology to avoid some belongings were taken out illegally .
In some kindergarten , an RFID is used with tabbing the child to keep a record of their attendance and whereabouts .
On the condition that the kindergarten students are very young and they do not have a very sound self-conscious , this system could prevent them from losing .
All in all , an RFID system being used to catch the information about the object and track .
This function could be used in many aspects .
By RFID , a customer who is potential for buying a very expensive luxury would be less reluctant to consider what if it lost , because the RFID can help them get it back .
This would inversely improves the sale in the shops .
Although in many respects , this technology can be used for positive and evidently beneficial ways , in some areas it is so controversial .
The most controversial part may be a human identification .
It probably can be divided into several types .
The first type is just say the ID cards which are carried externally on the people .
By using this card , our identities could be confirmed and the information about a certain institutions can be kept .
However , this will raise the privacy protection issues .
How can it be guarantees that our information would not be abused ?
Maybe this part can be resolved by using another technology .
For example , the ID cards could be implanted into a switch which can be controlled by the owner .
When not using it , just switched off the cards , then it would be just a useless paper .
Another human identification are implanting RFID chips into human bodies .
For this part , not only the privacy problem is concerned , but the human health .
Does the implant chip definitely safe and feasible ?
Will it affect the normal functionality of the other organs ?
All of these problems are waiting to be resolved .
In solutions , surveillance technology has been used for a much broader area .
Some have been widely accepted by the public but some were not .
Actually , this technology is very useful and shoulder is definitely going to be used .
What should be concerned is how it can be applied in the right area in the right way .
If there is some controversy , how it can be improved .
Only if it is making use of the wise and sensible approach and is adjusted and refined very profoundly , can it bring us maximize benefits .
Surveillance technology should be used to track people .
The technology was necessary because it could provide evidence of crime investigation and social issues and decreases the illegal actions effectively .
Firstly , surveillance technology is useful in crime investigations and public issues .
It could provide an objective view of what happened .
It records the history which nobody can deny .
In crime investigation , the truth of evidence was necessary , which can only be made with photos , video or small track .
In supermarkets monitoring is needed because we have to track thieves .
In front of ATM we need monitoring to avoid intentional crimes .
We need CCTV on every public corner to track suspicious .
Only in this way can we get evidence of bad movement to protect others .
The objective truth by CCTV are helpful and efficient in crime investigations , better than asking witnesses again and again to identify who is a liar .
Secondly , surveillance technology could decrease the illegal actions effectively .
Imagine there were no CCTV in public .
People will act as if there is no supervision .
No evidence was recorded .
Cheat can be very popular for examination and stealing will seldom incurring punishment .
In a Chinese kindergarten , child is always abuse by a teacher but no one else knows that .
Children tell their parents .
Some parents are too busy to take care of children while other parents do not believe what children said .
The headmaster did not know how the teachers really is and she did not fire her even when some children were afraid of entering the teacher 's class .
After so many children are abused , people come to know the truth .
Shadow was made for children 's heart and there is nothing we can do to make up for it .
Now people suggest that every classroom of every kindergarten should have a monitor , otherwise the teachers ' actions could not be supervised .
If there had been a monitor in a classroom , maybe parents and headmaster could realized earlier how severe and how bad the truth is and children could get protection earlier .
People might say that surveillance technologies will be abused intentionally to authorized people .
It really happened in China .
In a car accident related to an official 's relative , the record was modified by a new record .
The people of the records had been changed to another one before it is released to the public .
The modification is so obvious that people can easily recognize .
In China , things like that would happen because the legal system is not sound enough .
Power is concentrated on a few people .
The problem with abuse of surveillance is only the problem of abuse of power .
Avoid corruption and separate power is more important than forbidding surveillance technology .
In conclusion , surveillance technology is necessary in many public places in my opinion because we need it to crime investigations and social issues .
There was a truth that we could not deny which is that surveillance technology could provide a sense of safety because sometimes machine is more honest than people .
We have to admit that how to prevent abuse and how to use it reasonably depends on a sound legal system , and it means surveillance has its own restrictions .
Surveillance technologies such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) has been made possible to track people for implanting certain markers of people or products .
This is more than convenient for the authorities to take better control of the society down to every individual .
However , with respect to civil rights and privacy , surveillance technologies such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) should not be used to track people .
In the first place , every civilized person more or less disliked the idea that he or she is being closed watched every second .
By law , citizens have the right to keep their privacy unknown in public , whereas the privacy would be exposed if such surveillance technology is applied widely .
Many pupils in China have been complaining to their phones , because the phone in hand , their lives are all transparent with their parents .
Such technologies would put people into the same circumstances as those pupils where the government plays the role of parents try to find out whatever people are doing every second .
If pupils felt uncomfortable being watched by parents , citizens definitely is unhappy being watched on a big brother .
Close surveillance is not only a problem of bad feeling , but also the problem to the health of a society .
Some people might claim that it is good for security as when every one is under tracking , those potential criminals also were .
By logic it seems perfectly right .
However , whether the behavior is a crime is dependent on the authority .
When the authority treats liberty as a crime , the society became terrible .
It has been doubted that whether a society that is under close surveillance would be a good one to live in .
Many science fiction has made good efforts by describing the future of humans in which every body of society was put under close surveillance by the government .
Surprisingly , none of these are describing the future as the bright one .
In history , there are times when the government wants to secure its governance so badly that its police sniffing around people like dogs , such as the Nazi Germany , the Soviet Union .
People nowadays would agree that it was terrible to live in those societies .
Then why would they agree to put themselves into those societies ?
A bad thing is that one might not even be aware that he or she is being tracked .
If such things do happen , then the society would be moved in a dangerous direction without being noticed .
Imagine that one day , one was suddenly arrested at his normal life by the police and told that he is accused of posting anti-society statements on the Internet .
And all the evidence had been collected from hidden surveillance when he though he was expressing his opinion about the safe house !
In summery , surveillance technology should not be used to track people in order to keep the society comfortable and safe to live in .
What should really be put into close surveillance is the government .
People must make sure that the government was not abused its power in ways including tracking people .
There is one thing is common in the world described by many fiction - chips being implanted in humans and records its location , history and even thought about that time .
The readers are just smiled when they flip the pages because it never came to their mind that one day it may come true .
However , the world is always beyond our imagination and never let us down .
Actually , this technology has already been woven into our lives .
We benefited from surveillance technologies for many years and in many ways .
Travelers survive in deserts thanks to GPS guided them .
The police seized a criminal thanks to CCTV .
Having power can help people to achieve lots of things ; however , abuses will guide us in another direction .
Tracking people are one way to abuse technology and in fact , it happens every day .
Although we are not implanted chips we were exposed under CCTV .
It is a common question asked of lots of people that as the technology develops and we benefit from it , we are losing our privacy .
We could not deny that surveillance technology is a great achievement that secured us and protect us from criminals but we also could not ignore the lease on our privacy and even limit our freedoms .
My life now is exposed to lots of CCTV .
Every day when I opened my door and went to lady 's through the corridor , I was recorded at 3 CCTV .
I need to dress up neatly in case one day someone checked the CCTV will find a girl with weird clothing .
When I worked , it seems I was holding my heart work since if I was doing something wrong or relax in work time .
Next minute , I might have a tea with my manager .
Such a nightmare owing to abuse of surveillance technology .
Although we all understand the installed CCTV was used to protect us from criminals , nowadays , it seems to be abused too much .
According to article lawful interception , for us , every telecommunications companies have contracts with FBI , requiring them to keep the phone call records easily searchable and accessible by FBI .
Moreover , as shown by many Hollywood movies , Google mail is also accessible by FBI .
There are so many people from FBI , although it was under strict rules , and we could not think ideally there would not be any one abused its power and access those resources to private purposes and lease them out .
Leasing of private information , even though it only happened one time , but one is too many for the individual .
Moreover , the money spent on telephone call records were $ 1.8 million per year .
" The Big Brother is watching you " ( Orwell , < 1984 > ) , a fictional world described by George Orwell 's novel now turns out to be true .
There is only one thing different .
Our life was not only exposed to big brother .
Instead , owing to CCTV , telephones and other RFID , we are becoming characters in the play watched by someone , but we seldom noticed it , that is why it is horrible for our lives .
As a fast growing in electrical technology , people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our lives to make full use of it .
Many advantages have been shown in areas like politics .
Because of the surveillance technology , more and more things are under track and more and more clues can be used .
However , disadvantaged has also been gradually disappearing as the fruit people are enjoying .
That is to say , there are more and more doubts raised by the public about the surveillance technology .
From the view of my point , I think the application should only be authorized to people in some specific fields like politics and public security .
Firstly , privacy will not be protected if everything is under monitoring .
We could not imagine our every move is under track and there may be someone who is staring at you in some places through the monitor .
That sounds like we are naked in front of the public , there is no secret and even privacy for us .
Perhaps that the surveillance was installed for the sake of safety , but actually it conversely makes us has a lack of safety .
Therefore , the surveillance technology could not be casually uses .
Secondly , it might be used for lawbreakers .
There is no denying that every coin has two sides .
The technology also applies .
On one side , we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the rate of crime .
On the other side , the technology could also be probably used by the lawbreakers to commit crimes .
And once this happens , privacy does not exist any more and people 's lives is under great threatened .
Therefore , this technology carries great risk when we can only see the advantages that have been appearing .
Thirdly , it is also a waste of time and money if we use it in our daily lives .
Say , a person whose salary is 2000 dollars per month .
And he spent 1000 dollars to install a surveillance system at his house .
Then if his house gets stolen , perhaps he can use surveillance to get his money back .
However , if nothing happens inside his house , then the surveillance became useless , and he will also feel very uncomfortable because his every move was being supervised .
Therefore , for ordinary people , there is no need for them to use this technology .
Otherwise , it is just a waste of resources .
From the reasons above , we can see that the surveillance technology takes great danger of it so that we could not apply it to our daily lives .
However , we can take the essence and reject its dross .
That is to say , we can use it on some specific and special areas such as public security and politics .
These fields are special because of the job categories , and the need to be open to the public , so the disadvantaged will not be shown .
Contrarily , it could help to supervise the public figures in politics and tracked the offenders on security .
Therefore , the surveillance technology should not be used except for some specific jobs .
Surveillance technologies such as Radio-Frequency identification ( RFID ) to track the population is potentially be dangerous weapon in the government against its own people .
It should therefore not be used to track the population in order to protect people 's privacy and the idea of democracy .
Using surveillance technologies such as Radio-Frequency identification ( RFID ) to track the population can be seen as merely progression of older technologies such as identification cards .
A possible benefit was better statistical analyses , which will provide the government with more information when drafting policy .
However , in this very non-ideal world where corruption is abundance , wide usage of such surveillance technology and accurate tracking is potentially a dangerous , perverted and deadly weapons .
Illustrations that are both hypothetical and yet concrete is action spy movies , such as the Bourne identity .
In the movie , the spy agent access the public street cameras to track Jason 's Borne whereabouts .
This clearly illustrates how the corrupt government may breach its civilians ' privacy .
In addition , corrupt officials might sell this tracking information to the mafia .
Misha ( 2008 ) explains in his book 'McMafia ' that the shadow market accounted for 20 % of the global economy .
Judging by the crazy yet realistic anecdotes about gangsters , human traffickers , and yukky in his book , it is not difficult to imagine the opportunistic nature of human taking opportunity on this marvelous tracking technology .
The people who were on the run from the mafia will be at risk !
Surveillance technology should also not be used to protect people 's liberties and freedom of opinion .
The idea of democracy and power of the people will be at risk if people are tracked .
The ability to track every individual will empower dictators and their secret police .
Already without these technologies , the secret police agencies are able to track their prey and unsuspecting rebels .
An example is the Nazis secret police of Hitler used to dispose ( their bodies literally ) and stamp out any of Hitler 's opposition used fear ( and maybe guns , knives , poisons ) .
As previously mentioned there are benefits to this surveillance and tracking technologies .
Trends in the highly emotionally and easily manipulated human can be tracked , analysis , archived and chronicles .
Trends in society and culture can therefore be observed as a function of time .
These statistical analysis will give government more accurate information when drafting policy .
An example of making a good informed decision is the story of the planning and constructing a walking path , where the government has a lack of information and decide that the people need a proper concrete walking paths and built one of the randomly locations .
However , they could have built a walking path to a dirt path that had been walked out to the people themselves .
Knowing that this was a favorable routes to the people , the government now had sufficient information to build a walking path that truly benefit the people .
Still a possible downfall of these surveillance technology is too present in my paranoid minds and they clearly overweight the benefit , in my opinion .
It is therefore good to stick with the status quo .
With the development of technology , we have more advanced methods to track people in today 's society .
Surveillance technologies such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is frequently used by the police to track people who were considered suspicious .
However , the using of surveillance technology is usually done secretly , and the debate has been aroused today that whether surveillance technology should be abandoned .
Some socialist argue that installing surveillance devices from people offended human right and should be totally abandoned .
However , people who are taking security jobs asserting that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and make it easier for them to track those suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectively .
In my point of view , surveillance technology should still be used to track people to present since there are no good solutions .
The application for surveillance technology is the most effective method to track people and thus could help the police a lot .
Although that method might invade certain people 's rights and privacy , but in exchange for that we can get a safe and peaceful society .
If the surveillance technology being abandoned , it makes the police very difficult to track suspicious people and can have little control of those people who are dangerous to society .
For example , without surveillance technology , the murder could escape much more easily since no one knows their positions .
Without surveillance technology , a suspicious people might actually commit the murders and the murder could be much more serious if the police could not arrive in time to help out .
On the other hand , the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murder and they may not commit more murders since they may be afraid of being tracked by the police .
If that technology was abandoned , it may trigger more bad people to commit murder or steal things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not be punished by the law .
Therefore , the continuation of using surveillance technology is really necessary .
Although surveillance technology should not be totally abandoned , regulation of use that was expected .
With the popularization of surveillance technology , a more concise and more complete regulation of use that is highly needed .
For example , making ordinary people not allowed to use that and did not let a surveillance device accessible to the ordinary people so that abuse usage of surveillance technology could be avoided , which is also an effective way to protect human rights .
Only police should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help track the murder or people suspected .
With proper use of surveillance technology , surveillance technology can be a good tool for the police , and also benefit all society .
It is unavoidable for some socialist to argue that surveillance technology invaded human rights , however , for the sake of whole societies , surveillance technology should still be used .
As long as the regulations by using that are obeyed , surveillance technology could serve as a good tool .
In a modern society , public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenon .
In the United States , after a horrible attack on 11 September , the US congress passed the Patriot Act , which was mainly from increased domestic surveillance , counter against the terrorists .
However , although these bureaucratic actions prevented another similar attack from happening again , the act was widely criticized for its violations over individual privacy .
With the development of surveillance technologies such as RFID , spy on the population can be much easier , which would create even worse scenery of the citizens .
In this paper , the incorrectness of using technologies such as RFID to track people would be proved in the discussion for violation of privacy , the trend of misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority .
First , a violation of privacy would be dramatically increased .
Typically , the RFID tags are small devices on a read-only chips .
The regular distance for data exchange could be several meters .
Once such chips are loaded with personal information and implanted in individuals , all the information about his or her life could be recorded .
Some supporters might argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification at places like airports and check points .
However , the fact is that such technology will create check points everywhere .
Furthermore , such tracking of individual was done without permission from the subject peoples .
That is to say , people will being surveilled by every moment without awareness .
In such situations , individuals will lose their basic privacy .
Second , when technology like RFID is widely used , there will be a trend of misuse such technology .
An important feature of RFID is a minimal security .
Since it is read-only , the card could not protect itself .
Moreover , almost every one can gain access to the card reader as a reader require only simple technology .
Then , if a business man wants to defeat his competitors , he can just buy the reader and spying for commercial secrets .
Hence , once RFID is widely used , people are very likely to spy on each other , which would destroy trust , respect and many moral values .
Third , to use the surveillance technologies will enhance the totalitarian power at the authority .
The government is supposed to serve the people .
However , once the government gathered too much power , a democracy may be turned into totalitarianism , and such surveillance technology provides the measure .
Spy and collect excessive information about individuals is the first step .
When government be able to find out all the precise information to its citizens , it can gradually applied control over them .
Consequently , the government is very likely to turn to is the totalitarian authority , which would be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen .
All in all , surveillance technologies such as RFID should not be used to track general population for a violation of privacy , the trend of misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power at the authority .
Privacy must be respected , and power over others should be controlled .
Without such surveillance technology , we can still live a better future .
With the development of science and technology , people nowadays are living under various surveillance , for example , CCTV can be seen almost everywhere in public areas .
Recently , a new coming surveillance technology called radio-frequency identification which is RFID with short has caused heated discussion about whether it should be used to track people .
Some people think RFID should be banned out of privacy considerations .
However , as far as I am concerned , use RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration , rescue and police events .
During scientific exploration , especially a geographical one , the tracking is very important .
This tracking will help scientists to better get their results and clear exploration route information will also be useful for post-research when scientists came back .
In addition , people who research on biodiversity would also need to be tracked .
When these scholars were on the field journey , they also have to relate their observations of their route information ; this is when RFID is of great significance .
In addition , field journeys are sometimes very dangerous .
Observers are likely to go into a rural forest or mountainous areas .
Their safety may face huge challenges .
For this kind of situation , RAID will help a lot .
Actually , not only by scientific observations but also during adventure journey or travelling , RFID could defend human beings from harm .
Firstly , know where the travellers were and may go can assist them to know what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change direction to avoid a potential danger .
Furthermore , by telling the geographical position of the people , RFID could accelerate the rescue process and would improve the survival rate of the victims .
During the rescue , every second is valuable !
RFID is also functional for policing events .
By getting the track at the suspensors , police officers could decide who the criminals exactly was soon and easier to gain the truth behind the criminal event .
Furthermore , knowing where a criminal is will also simplify the chasing process .
Policeman can just go to a certain place and chased the criminals .
Besides , tracked people about potential dangers would be helpful to the safety department to predict the harm and better avoid the problem .
Some people may argue that use RFID to track people would leave out individuals ' privacy .
Nevertheless , the activities I mentioned above are related little about privacy issues .
Firstly , for scientific exploration , rescue and police event , the privacy factor is far less important than the individual or social safety and scientific results .
In addition , by observation journeys and travel , we only need to use RFID to some certain individuals and they would agree with this action for their own benefit .
Above all , I think we could not ban the use of RFID completely , since it would be of great help in human 's benefit during scientific exploration , rescue and police events .
By using this technology reasonably , it will assist people to walk faster and further in the long and rough civilization developed path .
Not being imprisoned for Surveillance Technology
With the development of science and technology , surveillance technology is playing its role in people 's lives .
It monitors anybody 's movements or activities , and enables us to identify suspects involved in any misdoings which violate the law , etc .
When surveillance technologies like RFID brings lots of convenience to our lives , some people argue that this kind of technology actually makes us feel unsafe .
Personally , I think surveillance technologies such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) should not be used to track people , with the benefits it brings to me could not match the concerns it caused .
It has been quite a long time since someone raised the importance of the right to privacy .
Without doubt , surveillance technology is going against the right since it leaked out people 's information without getting their permission .
When the technology is not so well developed , it may not be a big problem for leaking limited information .
While as it becomes highly developed , it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tell lots of people where do you go and what do you do .
It gives you a feeling that all people were watching a movie , and you are a hero whose every movement include using the toilet was under other observations , just like what is shown in the movie The Truman Show which chronicled the life of a man who was initially unaware that he was living at the constructed world , broadcast by billions of people .
When I have such feelings , I will feel that I am not belong to human beings as everyone else any longer , instead , I was like a pet or a tool of being made fun of by others .
It was more like a prisoner 's life , because we were under other people 's control and we can do nothing to change our situation .
On the other hand , when we allow surveillance technology being used to track people , it increases the successful rate for people taking bad actions .
For example , thieves can easily find out the best time to visit our house and kidnappers can take away our kids every time if they are informed about everyone 's location .
That would also cause more social concerns .
However developing our society is , technology should always serve us as a tool instead of constrained us like ropes .
Every technology was born in its advantages and its shortcomings just like nuclear power or weapons .
If we can not choose the proper way to use it , we tasted a bad consequences for it .
As surveillance technology which was not only inefficient enough in improving our life quality but also violates our rights to privacy , I think we should not use it to track people .
All of us hope to live in a free , more relaxed and safe world .
Population ageing is a global phenomenon as shown by China , India , Europe and even more countries and regions .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
Projections by the United Nations indicated that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries were increasing by 2 % to 3 % annually .
The rising expectancy is considered as a challenge as less workforce is results if population ageing ; high burden for governments to support the source of living for excessive age people .
However , it was considered as an achievement as there is low competencies in workforce .
Rising life expectancy is a two-sided sword which is both a challenge and an achievement .
Rising life expectancy resulted in fewer workforce available .
Fewer young people and more elder people were existing globally .
This results in an unbalanced ratio between young people and older people .
This is a challenge as it reduces the productivity of countries , and hence affect the productivity of the world .
Globally , manpower is lacking .
Although current world is the digital world which more machines being used to replace manpower , manpower be required to operate these machines so that they can better functioning .
In countries like Singapore , manpower is the only natural resource available which Singapore can invest in as she did not have enough land to build farms and factories .
In addition , Singapore focused more on developing its tertiary industry which is mainly consisting of services .
People are needed .
More importantly , Singapore wanted to be a knowledge base country , more highly educated people are required .
Ageing resulted in less manpower and less highly educated people are available in proportion .
More elderly people are a burden to the society as more funds are required by the government to support their standards of living .
In general trends , elderly people are easy to be ill as compared to young capable adults .
More healthcare is needed for elderly people than young adults .
In most countries healthcare is provided freely in government .
As a result , government needs more tax on companies in order to have enough money to provide healthcare for elderly people .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
This is an age which most people are retired and have no source of income .
Their purchasing power is low .
In the aged population , low spending affect economic growth .
Companies are in trouble if they could not earn sufficient money to sustain their businesses and they also need to pay high taxes to the government .
Population ageing is a challenge of economic development .
Despite the challenges of ageing populations , it is an achievement as less people are for competency to bid for one job positions .
Therefore , people are generally less stress at work .
Life is more enjoyable for young adults .
Rising life expectancies also indicates that standard of living is improving for majority of people .
Healthcare is better than in the past .
They can live longer as they can afford high healthcare fares to maintain their health in a good condition .
In conclusion , rising life expectancy is a challenge as it results in more potential problems for future sustainable economic development .
However , it is an achievement as it is an indication that our society is progressing well and people are living in better conditions .
With an aging population , many countries are facing the same challenges as to build safety house , facility to cater to the old aged .
After a certain age , they will have to retire .
The challenge for many aging country will rise when no new generation could take over their place in that particular trades .
First , I will discuss with the challenge of having the ageing populations such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population started to age and jobs which have no young people taking over which can lead to economic downfall .
Secondly , I will discuss an ageing population as the achievement where they implemented healthier lifestyles and good eating habits .
When people started to age , many diseases would surface up un-noticing .
Therefore , for the welfare of the ageing population , more old age hospitals will have to be built .
Land space will be limited when more hospice was built to take care of the elderly people .
With illnesses surfacing and an increase of ageing population , increasing amounts of nurses and doctors will have to be present .
However , not many young people are passionate about helping society or even helping the elderly .
Hence , the country will face a big challenge as to take care of the elderly .
In addition , retirement is a must in some countries .
This could cause a drastic fall in their economy as if the younger generation could not take over their work , no one will continue .
It was thus a big challenge in a country as there is no one boosts their economies .
The ageing population could be the achievement as this indicates measures are being implemented to have a healthier lifestyle by the people .
The more old people a country has , the more experience they would be as most elderly people can share their old experience to the younger generation and make them not making the same mistake as them .
This will help the country move forward rapidly .
The more exercise or any other form of working out can prolong the lifespan of people .
It also indicates that the food people eat is nourishing and could decrease the amount of illness that can cause death , thus live longer .
Food can be a big part of our lives .
Eating the right amount of healthy or junk food can be a cause of having a longer or shorter lifespan .
An example would be in Korea .
It is said that kimchi can reduce the chances of having cancer and in addition , the people will have a good skin complexion .
True enough , their population is ageing but people there can live very long due to the food they are consuming .
Thus , food can play an important role in the population .
As life could be precious , an aging population could be an advantage as well as a disadvantage in a particular country .
A balanced phenomenon should be seen in one nation .
Rising life expectancy could be seen as a good or a bad trend for others .
Therefore , every country should try to maintain both young and old generations balanced .
Studies have shown that the life span is getting longer which reflects the rising life expectancy .
It was clear that population ageing is happening all over the world , since the current average life span is 65 and the population above the age of 60 are getting increase year after year .
This shows a rising life expectancy , it was an achievement and it is also a challenge .
The rising life expectancy may be due to several different reasons , for example , it may be because of the improvement in the living conditions , or because of the upgrade on the cleanness of the living environment , or because of the wide arranged for nutrition that absorbed by a human , or because of the development of the medication systems in the country .
No matter which reason stated above exactly dominant in the rising life expectancy it was one of the evidence on the achievement of human nation .
It is a technology development enabling an improvement in the living conditions ; the discovering of the food and nutrition that are more suitable and more necessary for humans to absorb ; the various medicines that could be used to cure different diseases .
Without all this technology we may need to live in the same condition like centuries ago , with a higher death rates when diseases spread around the world and the human nations have no solutions .
The rise in life expectancy shown the human nation has overcome some of the challenges of the natural environment around us during the existence of so many centuries therefore it is an achievement .
However , the rise in life expectancy is also a challenge to the entire human nation .
With the population aging problem getting more and more serious all over the world , the shortage of various kinds of resources challenge most of the countries in the world .
First , food resources and medication resources are the most important to support the living human beings .
And also an over crowded modern cities also raises problems for public transportation , unevenly distributed wealth and education resource shortages also were the problems that some countries that might face .
Although rising life expectancy is a challenge to the entire human nation , the detailed problem each country that will encounter is different .
It is clear that problems that may face in developed and developing countries are different .
For developing countries , they might encounter more of the shortage of food resources and and the problem of how to develop good medication system to serve the entire nation , and they also face the problem of how to distribute the wealth evenly to benefit the entire population , more overs they need to consider carefully how to build the education system so that the next generation of the population will be able to carry on to raise the whole country .
For developing countries , the challenges they faced mainly are over crowded modern city usually face the public transportation problems and also the unevenly distributed wealth which resulted in that some of the population unable to benefit from the development of the human society in terms of technology which improves the life quality .
In conclusion , the rising life expectancy could be considered both challenging and achievement .
Ageing population is prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being frowned upon in most of the developing countries .
As a standard of living increased , the affordability of high quality healthcare services and medical technology , which has advanced over the decades , among the general public has become increasingly available .
People in the nation were likely to be well-taken care of , partly because of the various healthcare incentives and scheme provided by the respective governments .
In the following , I would take Singapore as a case study as a reference to my discussions .
Rising life expectancy could be a pro to family affairs .
There is a Chinese saying that goes , " Jia you i law , rub you i bar " .
This means , has an elderly at home is equivalent to having a gold at home .
Where every home housing the elderly , the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and morale values .
Where filial piety and respect for elders is highly emphasized in Chinese tradition , the children can learn to respect and interact with their grandparents from a young age and so as to their parents .
With good communication and interaction , the elderly can guide the young of valuable lessons about life .
An individual is a unit of the society , every good individual thus is a precious contribution to the society and nation 's growth .
On the other hand , the rising life expectancy can also be an indication , though not entirely , to the country 's reputation for their citizens .
A long-lived and healthy individuals are sometimes is related to a good standard of living and healthcare services that one receives .
In another words , it indicates that the national healthcare system are effective , well-managed in the government .
This gives credit for the government 's medical and healthcare scheme .
Thus , rising life expectancy could be seen as an achievement for the Government 's well-planned or managing schemes .
However , this should not be entangled with the idea that high life expectancy equates to the nation 's provision of quality healthcare benefits and life to the senior citizens .
Ageing population is often viewed negatively in the developing countries where they are economic drive .
In order to cope with an ageing population that pulled down or hinder economic development , more physically capable and young workforce was required for the society .
If failed to fulfil this requirement , this would lead to more financial strains such as increasing taxes imposed by the societal or companies working group .
This could cause more societal issues such as low satisfaction in working groups towards the government , decreasing birth rate where people could not afford the child expenses in their upbringing and educational fees , that adds more burdens and worrying for the government .
As the overall , the rising life expectancy could be considered as a pro and con about the country .
Pro , in terms of the intangible aspects such as emotional and mental development of the future generations and contribution to the country 's well reputation .
Con , on the other hand , in terms of tangible aspects mainly from the economic drive and desire in the nation for the sustainability of their economic position and reputation in the world .
The rise in life expectancy globally can be challenged and yet the achievement when the problem of human could be medically disturbing .
These few problems are taking a toll on human life over the years when they are over 60 years of age .
Most of the illness lies about mental illness , musculoskeletal pain and sight and hearing loss .
It was a challenging where this illness ca n't are easily avoided by any person of such a stressful lifestyle at any place in the world .
Medical advances which help to cure this illness is also got better over the years which helps with a rise in life expectancy .
When a person grows old , the medical needs of the people increases over the years relative to the age of the person .
The number and types of illnesses also increased relative to the age too .
This is particularly seen in many parts of the world .
As the amount of stress , the type of food mixed with chemicals and the quality of life in terms of environment is getting bad .
More variations in medical needs are required to help increase the life expectancy of any human .
More challenging also included the environment challenges that were seen over the years .
By the rate of environmental damage , we could see that the lifestyle of a normal human being has to be changed .
These changes and damage also increases the chance to contact more illnesses as we age .
Therefore the challenge is that we need to maintain or improve the state of living is a huge challenge .
The ability to eliminate the illness is considered as an achievement as this proves that the ability of the human race to research and develop a medical ability to solve and eliminate the harm that is able to take the life of a human away from an early age .
This ability is not seen 40 years back where the technology advances are not as good as now .
All these technology advancements also helps to improve the lives of human race in terms of improving the lifestyles , environment and medical ability .
Therefore , achieve such great fretting , in these areas is considered as an achievement where human life was then improved and extended the life of us .
Moreover , achieved the near impossible to eliminate all the illnesses such as cancer and diseases is the greatest achievement of human race .
This step needed the ability to take a long time to research to make it possible .
Much more could be done to reach the stage of extending the lifespan of human beings .
In conclusion , we could see that in order to solve the challenges such as the amount of illnesses that could be growing over the years , the damage to our living environments and stressed that was always building in the city life .
There is always a way out where the achievements are done by humans who use their time to help most people improve our basic needs and lives for a living and extension of our life expectancy .
Rising life expectancy could be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
We should separate it into two aspects .
The first one is that rising life expectancy could be considered as a challenge .
The second one was that rising life expectancy can also be considered an achievement .
They are not contradict each other .
In my opinion , the challenge interception was to make comparisons with the cross direction , which is comparing the current situation to the assumed situation .
On the other hand , the achievements perceived is to make comparisons with the wire direction , which is comparing the current situation to the historical situations in the past .
So , in the following , I will clarify these two different views of rising life expectancy .
For the first part , rising life expectancy is a challenge .
We should images that when life expectancy was raised up ; this will mean that the average age of the population of nations wise or globally are also rising .
The number of older people will increase to make the average life expectancies high .
For these older people , a society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them .
Sometimes , old need more man power and resources than normal young people .
However , these old people usually contribute less or nearly had no productivity in the society .
We have to say that old people are becoming a black hole of an entire society in terms of man power and resources .
So the dilemma took place when there are more people who have a higher age .
Not only has the family members of the old people , but also the government need to spend a lot of effort to handle such situations .
This is an interpretation of challenge of rising life expectancy .
For the second part , rising life expectancy was also an achievement .
The achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history of the past .
In ancient times , due to less development of science and technology , people having less medicine or medical equipment and take less care to their healthy .
Hence people died of various diseases .
On the other hand , there is not sufficient material or ways to improve people 's daily lives .
People do not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed tooth .
These small things make the quality of people 's lives less enjoyable than today .
Bad moods can not give them a long time in life .
Due to all these reasons , people die quite early , which resulted in a low life expectancy .
So , the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people are living .
In that sense , rising life expectancy could be considered as an achievement .
From these points , we ourselves should be glad that we can live longer and enjoy a better living environment .
Besides , we should not forget the responsibility on our shoulders , the older people .
We should try our best to take care of them as if we were the ones who are old .
In such a situation , the society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way .
We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievements .
As the world was at a turning point in entering into the stage where people are constantly and notably older than before , how to make life easy , comfortable as well as healthy have been shedding light on .
Life expectancy is the figures that reveal the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population aging problem .
However , there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and achievement .
Rising life expectancy is a challenge in the sense that it is highly relied on development of medication .
There is a series of diseases that hinder longevity .
Cancers , as a major group of killing disease , is often beyond current medications to get fully healed .
Once cancer is too late to discover , one was deemed to death at a later stage .
Other diseases such as mental disorders and heart trouble is also top killers , the current medication does have methods to treat the patient , but risks still comes along .
Apart from disease themselves , deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiencies during the treatment process could also restricted to make lifespan longer .
Patients in many developed and less developed countries , especially African countries , is suffering from simple and easy-to-heal diseases such as colds and flu and probably by the end of the day it became the ends of their lives , albeit they could have been treated well if they are in a country where medication system had been completed and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people .
To raise life expectancy , one of the questions was how to upgrade the current medication system .
Government should help encourage a breakthrough as well as complete medication system .
Rising life expectancy is also an achievement .
Development of technology is making our lives easier and more comfortable .
Compared with a world of ancient Rome or China where almost no machines were involved , people nowadays is producing batches and batches of merchandise in factories .
Machines have replaced a bunch of coolies and heavy labour .
Cars and trucks diminishes the redundancy of long time shipments .
As a result , people have more time to enjoy advantages in modern life .
One could easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one dream in his lifetime .
One can also easily see his deeply loved ones through internet from miles away .
More importantly , they can share their ideas about how to keep healthy through internet , to make more interested people get involved and find ways to make lives longer and more wonderful .
The development of technology brings people joy , make things easier and this may be one of the achievement .
In conclusion , it was delighted to observe the fact that life expectancy is rising , but one must have an idea in mind that rising life expectancy is never easy .
There were a series of problems that hinder longevity such as current medication .
But data that showed a rising life expectancy is indeed an achievement that revealed an improvement in modern life .
As for the future , who knows ?
We are on the right track .
Probably the next breakthrough is around the corner in the near future .
In recent decades , it is the trend that people are able to live a long life .
This is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of medication and people 's living conditions .
While it is applaudable that people achieved great success in prolonging their lives , there are social challenges posted by the rising life expectancy .
Without a doubt , the rising life expectancy is definitely a success in human history as it shows the achievements of the medical industry to find out ways and medicines to treat diseases that are thought to be incurable by the past and provide people with vaccines to prevent disease .
The condition of the living environment is also improving that people are able to live with more hygienic place .
The improvements in technology also eases people 's lives by replacing all the manual labour work for easy and simple machine operative working .
Due to the three major factors stated above , people are no longer exposed to disease-breeding living environment , be able to cure their disease considered fatal last time and do not need to do much labouring work .
The rising life expectancy best proved these improvements and has definitely wrote a new chapter in the history human civilisation .
However , as life expectancy rises , some social challenge occurred as well .
As an ageing population grows , the young and more energetic people are subject to support more people in old age .
This creates a huge social burden on them and may cause some of them leave the country when the burden becomes unbearable .
This would result in the lost of manpower in the country .
Another aspect would be that as the young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves , they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burden on themselves .
This would result in decreases with birth rates in a country which is a very serious problem,especially in more developed countries as the population had already reached the minimum .
Government will be burdened with the growing aging population as well because it needed to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare for old people because they are in urgent need of it .
Less money will be left to develop the country and explore into new areas of business .
This would result in economic retardation and stagnation in the country .
After all , it might seem difficult to handle when an ageing population in the country grows , especially the developed countries with very small populations .
However , when we look at the bright side of the reality , the rise in life expectancy proved great improvement in various realms and solve many problems we have in the past , there was hope that an ageing population may transform into helpful force in the country for the future with the help of better technology and medications .
Life expectancy can be defined as desired level of services or better technology to make one 's life more comfortable .
People with current era is described as demanding or having high levels of life expectancy in another word .
They were expecting better medications , healthy food , and cleaner environments and so on and so forth .
However , this rising life expectancy has become a challenge and also and achievements of the population ageing .
Percentage of elders is increasing annually according to United Nations ' projections .
In another word , there is more elder who had lower productivity and more medical problem compared to younger people in this world population .
On the other hand , people demanding better quality of service and advanced technologies such as new I-Pad model .
In fact , these rising demand require a strong work force who are active and higher productive than the past .
However , ageing population is a phenomenon opposite of it .
Ageing populations led to a work force composed of large percentages of elders who were lower productivity and thus unable to meet the expectancy .
The second life expectancy is increasing medical technology and sources .
Aging population requires more medical sources since elders need more medical attention .
However , the health levels of world population showed an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it led to exponential growth in number of elder worldwide .
Nevertheless , provisions for more medicine and goods equipment as well as more medical centres is necessary to accommodate these elders .
Another rising life expectancy is a big house with a low price which were raised up by younger generations .
Ageing population is a consequence of increasing health levels of population .
The concurrent result is increasing size of population .
When the elder lived longer , the family size actually increase rather than decrease .
In addition , the younger generation eager to start their own families to another place rather than stay together with family .
This phenomena increases the demand for land property and subsequently affected their price and size together .
Increasing size of population also led to the problem of food supply .
The production of food are showing a lower growth rate compares with population 's growth rate which will end up with insufficient food in the future .
Rising life expectancy is also an achievement in government .
People expect more from the ground with their current economy , life stability and desire .
For example , one would like to have I-Phone 5 in the past but he or she would expect it to have more functions or operate at faster speeds after using it a while .
Thus , the rising expectancy actually reflect the increasing stability and comfort to people 's lives and indirectly reflect the ability of governments to provide people with their current comfort , economical statues , convenience and others .
Rising life expectancy is an achievement but it poses more challenges to government and people .
All have to work hard and cooperate to deal with these challenges on the way to meeting expectancy .
Otherwise , the comfort level of life will be maintained or lower down when the time pass or people should lower their expectancy in life .
People 's average age has become longer compared with the past .
From one perspective , it shows that the medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different deceased .
From another perspective , there are more and more elder people but less young ones , the increase in population ageing has weakened the labor force and so on .
In my opinion , the increase in population ageing was more a challenge than the achievement .
Firstly , the population ageing can be definitely viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology .
Compare the technology today and the past , we can see that a lot of deceased is treatable , the number of people that die because of a deceased that was not treatable decreases .
The fast development of medicines and technological products made people 's lives much healthier compared with the past .
Moreover , the increased technology helps people overcome different natural disasters .
People were able to predicate some disasters like the earth quakes and did a prevention beforehand .
Although the increase in population age shows that people have increased knowledge and technology , it should be considered as the challenge more than the achievement .
The technology is always improving and it never stopped , and the lifespan of people are getting longer as well .
Thus , we should not compare now in the past but we need to worried for the future problems that caused by this situation .
The first challenge was a decreasing number of new born .
As the population ages are growing , as people get old , they need to be cared for others and was not able to contribute as the same as they are young .
If the number of old people is too much and there is less numbers of young people , it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are less , productivity and technology improvements would be less .
At the same time more people were needed to take care of the old ones , which give the younger generation extra work .
The second challenge will be a shortage of natural resources .
As we know that populations of humans continue to growth year on year , we are using a non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life , for example , an oil , people 's lives and technology improvement was not able to continue without the usage of oil .
However , these natural resources are not renewable .
We do not consider much of our offspring .
Ever imagine one day that no natural resources is leaving what would be the lives of our next generation .
The increase in population means the larger the natural resources are needed and people have to think out some ideas like to prevent use too much natural resources .
In conclusion , the increase in population ageing shows both the human technology achievements and the new challenges like lack of young generation .
We have to consider more for our future generations , aware of the problems that over age brings to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges .
Soon after coming into the industrial age , human release the weapon and brought up a new technological era .
An improvement in engineering and medical science has been valued since humanism arose .
Studies have shown that the average life span or human is rising gradually over years , in the sense that the improvement in global technology in medicine helps humans to live longer and enjoy the world even more .
In spite of that , people should aware that the power of science is not almighty , life will still go to their last pages without revelations .
Since not all of the human being is going to be a doctor , people rely the skills of treatment by doctors and hence , they started to ignore the maintenance of their own health .
There is needless to doubt that the medical technology has enhanced day by day .
In the past , when people injured or fall into sickness , there is no guarantee that the people will get well treatment and fully recover , therefore people could easily die from infected with a small diseases .
With the grand medical skills we are having nowadays , humans living longer and hence , the great increase in population .
It would be great if life expectancy keeps rising up day by day , but in reality , it does not seem to be so easy .
Firstly , although the treatment is reliable , people would still need to have an awareness of their own health conditions .
There are millions of doctors all over the world , but there are billions of patients as well .
Nowadays , the pressure on the head of a company towards those employees causes that people have to be fully concentrated on their job and because of that , people start to ignore their health condition and relies on treatment and supplements .
Pressure could really cause sickness just like viruses and germs and it was more like a chronic disease .
It was like the key that opened up the gates of human body defends system and provides a clear path for other diseases in attack .
Therefore , when the era is improving itself , the disease does it too .
It is a big challenge to eliminate all the diseases in the world and keep the life span to grow as people do sick every moment .
Nevertheless , humans still need improvement .
By comparing to the past , it was a big step forward in development of medical science .
In an era of Warring state , warriors lost their arms or legs or even all of them .
The rest of their lives has to be relying on their families and financial support from the other .
Their lives are becoming meaningless and a lot of them have chosen to suicide without giving troubled by the other .
Nowadays , things have changed .
Disabled people walking on artificial legs , man could get pregnant , even a sexual in a human can be changed just by doing simple surgery .
It was really a great achievement for enhancement of technology which should be recorded in history .
In conclusion , the reason why population ageing is increasing majority is due to a great improvement in the global medical science .
It is a challenge but also an achievement .
Population ageing is a global phenomenon that arises from both developed and developing countries .
Average life span rose to 45 years old from 1920s for over 65 years old with 2010s .
In a social science report last year , this number will further increase to 90 years old from 2080s due to the advanced medical technology and better living standards .
Population ageing means that there are more retired old people in the society and the portion of working adults are decreasing .
It might cost high social cost burden which further leads to the allocation of funds from governments yearly budget .
Medical expenses , EFF and accommodation are the costs which directly involved with the old people .
It is responsibility on government to ensure a living in old people .
Otherwise , there are more and more people stay on the street and destroyed a good view of Garden City .
In addition , it is also a challenge to governments , families and parents to educate their children about the morals of filial .
With the morals of filial , most of the children will take care of their parents after their retirement life .
It is to prevent by sending them to old folk 's house and did not visit them at all .
We also do not want to see the happenings of bad things that parents were dropped to children along the streets and let them die themselves .
It may be a challenge but also golden opportunity to educate their children properly to prevent the undesired outcomes .
Life expectancy rose significantly in the past by recent in the whole world .
It was an outcome of advanced medical technology , change of lifestyle and higher living standards .
However , among the under-developed countries , developing countries and developing countries , we find that there are long life span of the developing countries followed by the developed countries and the shortest life span of under-developed countries .
The observations meant that the more developed countries , the longer the life span of citizens .
In other words , it also can be said that it was an achievement to obtain an ageing population .
It is proud to have an ageing population which is hard to achieve unless there are advanced medical technology and higher living standards .
Besides that , ageing population has an important and essential things that we could not buy in cash .
There is an experience of life time .
During the work , supervisors usually ask a so called " old staff ' to lead a newbie .
It shows that significant case in the important of experience .
With an existing on experience , we could do the work more quickly without sacrificing the standard and quality .
It might lead a short way from the decisions and provide more sales and revenue from companies .
The economies of countries are boosting up and further led to the new development and rising up our living standards .
In conclusion , there are challenges as well as achievement for a rising life expectancy which we could not exclude .
Therefore , we must encounter the challenges and being proud of the achievements to create a new life for our next generation .
In 1712 , Watt renovate the steam machines which increases the efficiency of the fuel .
This activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolution .
As the technology develops faster and faster during 301 years , people not only enjoy more and more material but also more and more health care which provide convenience to our daily lives .
This significantly raises people 's average life expectancy .
However , as the life expectancy of people rises , population ageing problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
Projections by the United Nations indicated that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries were increasing by 2 % to 3 % annually .
As the rise in life expectancy could be interpreted as a measure standards with the pace of technology development , it can be seen the achievement of human beings .
However , as the energy and resources used up , more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowds on earth would aggravate the ageing problem , so the rise in life expectancy can also be seen as a challenge .
As we are humans who are different from other animals , we have some basic rights like rights to privacy , rights for live , right to have a family and so on .
Among these basic rights , the most important one is the right to live .
During the less developed times , due to disasters like droughts ,floods or severe contagious diseases like black death , people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they did not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their lives in a short time .
However , as the technology develops , it increases people 's mobility and productivity so as life expectancy .
As we could use the resources for maximum efficiency , we can enjoy more and more life material than any time in human society .
Even when a disaster come , we can restore order in our lives in a relatively short time than before .
For example , a tsunami of Tohoku in Japan in 2011 was " the toughest and most difficult crisis in Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II " as CNN comments .
( CNN , 2011 ) However , only one year has passed , most of the survivors have come back to their normal life although on a sad memories .
This is not imaginable during less developed times .
With a strong back support for technology , the rise in life expectancy could be seen as an achievement for the development of our human society .
However , along with an increase in life expectancy , aging problem becomes more and more severe .
Two of the most important cause of aging problem is the increased longevity and declining fertility .
The increased longevity was due to fast development of a society so as a living pressure .
The increased pressures would lead to a declining fertility .
As people who were incapable of production became more and more , our society following a downward trend .
Moreover , as we use up more and more resources , what we have left may not enough for us to live in if we did not have enough human resources to do research in developing new technologies .
Therefore , the increase in life expectancy are also a great challenge .
As we have mentioned above , an increase in life expectancy is an achievement as well as a challenge .
In modern world , many global issues have been appearing like global warming , concepts of earth villages and population .
Nowadays , population ageing is becoming a problem especially in developing countries .
Now in Singapore , we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you went to Chinatown .
Population ageing also has brought us a question of whether we should raise life expectancy , it is challenging also could get some achievement .
In the first place , rising life expectancy could cause resource challenges .
In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong , if people still increases the humans ' lives , but in these small developing regions , the resources are very limited especially land .
Because the land is limited , so the average land from one person is very small already .
Some years , there was a report in Hong Kong citizens living situations , in a small room there are eight people , they could not do anything for the room , only can sleep and the air in the room was very bad .
So rising life expectancy will make the world population larger , more people should the limited resources .
In economics , we could use GDP to explain the challenge , if GDP is low , it shows that most people are living on the hard life , life quality is bad , then it will cause the terrible society problem , at last , it will happen a society disturbances .
The reason why it will happen is because people have violated the natural regulation .
On the other hand , rising life expectancy could bring some achievement .
People 's life quality has been good now , in order to continue improving , people have begun to consider how to raise their lives .
Because the lives and health is most significant , people have their own reasons for hope live longer .
On medicine , people have done a lot of research in life sciences .
Also people began to realize the importance of the environment , how to protect people from the harmful air .
So according to the humanism , people should make contributions from rising human life , because people should consider the feelings if one day when you are becoming older and older , so respect life should be considered carefully .
In addition , now there appears a contradiction if rising life expectancy , it will lead the resource problems .
However , based on the humanism , humans are different from the animals , people should respect every life .
In my opinion , I think we should study balancing it well , one side we should continue to make efforts to raise the human life , one side , we should consider using asked some sick old man whether if they want to take euthanasia .
To summary , we respect every life , also helps people to live longer .
In conclusion , what I have mentioned above , although global aging issues have become more serious about human development , if we can balance and understand why we live .
Then try to invent new energy and legitimately controlling population birth rate , then developed a medical treatment and pay enough attention , we have reason to trust , population aging will not be problem at all .
Population ageing : A more and more attention-getting topic
Nowadays , population aging has become a more global phenomenon .
Subsequently , a lot of problems regarding in it are arising .
Due the rise of the life span and the shrinking of the birth rate , the portion of the elderly portion is larger and larger .
As our society develops , the people have a much higher living standards , which would reduce the chance of getting disease .
Besides , as the development of the technology , the medical therapy also had the tremendous progress .
Many diseases which are incurable from the past could be cured now .
Therefore , the patient will have a big chance to be cured and survived .
Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of dying people annually .
On the other hand , the birth rate for many countries keep decreasing , whose figure is the lowest recorded compared to previous figures .
Maybe , it is because the modern society is becoming more and more competitive , the parents are paying much attention and importance of their careers .
They do not want to bother to spend so much time to raising and nurturing children .
Maybe that 's one reason for reducing the birth rate .
The fact is that the current average life span is over 65 and the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries were increasing by 2 % to 3 % annually .
This survey evidently showing that big achievement has been made by the medical areas and people 's living standard has been improved .
It also indicates that the economy has been dramatically grow .
Yet , do not be confused by this superficial amounts and achievement .
The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky .
First , if the older people increased , there will be fewer workforce that can support the society .
However , ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditures .
The most important part is health care and old-age pensions .
As elderly people , they need more money on health care than the young .
Government should also make a big amount of pension expenditures .
Secondly , for the old people , more facilities and services for them should be provided .
So more manpower will be employed , which deduced the labour in other areas .
Of course , more money will be spent .
To pay this extra money , governments will exert higher taxes on other people .
Thirdly , compared with the young people , the security of the elderly are more notable .
Elderly people 's ability to move and act is much lower .
They will be more vulnerable to being hurt or get some injured .
Therefore , some measurements and education in this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people .
To conclude , the population aged phenomenon indeed show our big achievement for economy , medical skills and living standards .
Nonetheless , the issues it brought out is more worthy to be considered .
More elderly people will bring a big extra burden to the society and government .
More facilities and services would be needed to fulfil these requirements .
Definitely , we should perform these demanding duties very responsibly and carefully .
Whereas , in the sustainable development of the country and the earth , some measurements and policy should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon .
Rising life expectancy is an achievement because it is the evidence of progress in modern medical technologies and meanwhile it is a challenge because it could incur a problem for lacking work force or too large populations .
It is natural that rising life expectancy is regarded as an achievement .
The goal of every species of living thing is reproduced to increase the quantity of this species .
Humankind is not an exception .
People with rising life expectancy can ensure large populations and large species of human beings .
It is more secure for us because of potential sense we think for longer life expectancies it is hard for people to die out .
Rising life expectancy is also evidence of progress in modern medical technologies .
For ancient people it was miraculous to achieve 70 years old , but now it is general .
Rising life expectancy can bring us more skilled work force because we could delay the retirement time to extend work time for each person .
Longer working period meant the old people who are more skilled does not need to retire and no fresh men will take over .
Thus it is more efficient to keep more skilled people from long time rather than train fresh man .
Rising life expectancy can be a challenge .
There are two possibilities .
On one hand , if there were less young people and more old people , lacking work force problems will arise .
On the other hand , if there are enough young people , then young people with rising life expectancy would cause large populations .
We talked about the first possibility .
If there were less young people and more old people , as in both Singapore and China , when elderly retired , there are not enough young people who can make up for the new available positions .
Thus there will be a lack of labour force , which will lead the decreasing speed of development in the country .
Many factories would be deserted and many companies will go bankruptcy , and thus people 's life conditions will definitely gotten worse .
The past 30-year rapid development of China was connected to a large population , but due to an " only child " policies , we have no benefit to large populations in the future .
With low birth rate , Singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and developments in the country .
If there are more young people , then there would be even more elderly with rising life expectancy in the future definitely .
Population is large while the resources are limited , which would incur many problems such as environmental problems and inequality among people .
Expansion of population can not continue like that because the resources are limited , and we will end of died out after using up all resources .
To sum up , with rising life expectancy , there exist both achievements and challenges .
It is the progress of human beings that we control the world and maintaining our population with longer life expectancies , but it also has potential crisis in either nation or a human being .
We can either step back to maintain a population of some methods , or stepping forward to search for more resources to outer space .
Population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively for advanced civilizations.It requires at least three conditions to happen : advanced health care system , reduce hazards on the environment and the ubiquitous good will of senior citizens .
However , when it happens , it is hard to deny that it brought problems such as increased expenses and reduced labour in the society .
If the country can bear the ageing population , it is the thing that the country can be proud of .
In the first place , it must have grasped advanced health care system .
Age problem is in essence the problem of worsening body .
With increasing age , people become more prone to disease and injury , and more difficult to recover .
Without advanced health care system , aged people have higher rates of death .
In fact , this is a major limitation on people 's average life span of the past .
With advanced medical technology , not only many diseases can be cured , but also people know how to keep themselves healthy .
If developed health care system is increasing the positive side , it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side , which included reducing the hazard to the environment .
Health caring by far has been expensive to carry out .
If the environment is too dangerous to live in , there would be not sufficient medical resources in usage .
Such environmental hazards come in various aspects .
A major source of the hazard is the pollution .
A place in heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habitat and would bring a lot of health problems for its residents , among which aged people and children would be harmed most .
Only if the city was safe and comfortable can people live longer and happier lives .
If the above two aspects are described as the hardware for the system , they do require a software function , which is a ubiquitous good will of senior citizens .
When people become old , most of them join a weak group of citizens who have to live in receiving care for other people .
If a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment , but did not grant access to them at its senior citizens , it just does not help .
And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly , nothing would be done for them .
Only when there was a ubiquitous good will of senior citizens can an ageing people live well , and that is a thing to be proud of .
With the glory , there came problem .
To take care of old people , facilities such as nursing homes should be built , which adds to the expense of society .
An even larger shares of the old people expense lies with the health care .
In addition , old people is weakening in many aspects , thus they are usually not considered as labour .
When the percentage of old people growing larger in the population , the labour being considered to become less and each labored need to pay more for the welfare of the old people .
In summary , the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it meant an increase to the load and the advance of society , including at least advanced advanced health care system , reduce hazards on the environment and the ubiquitous good will of senior citizens , at the same time .
" The weak are meat and the strong eating it " does not apply nowadays .
The advanced technology save lots of lives which should never come to this world or should pass away .
For people , this is an achievement , but by nature , it changed its rules and cycling , which was a big challenge faced by human beings .
If anyone has ever read any fiction or storied wrote before the 18th century , it is very hard to find any character in those stories live longer than 80 years old .
They may die of hunger , died of illness or just go to bed as usual but never woke again .
In China , there is a famous saying that there were things should be celebrated , one was red and one was white .
Here , red things mean marriage and white means someone passes away .
The first time when I read this saying I am confused why someone passes away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past , it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old , you will suffer a lot of illness or a sadness in your young relatives passed away , so people think it is worth celebrating since they would not suffer any longer .
It is very hard to understand such a feeling as people feel in the past .
Now , technology and science developed at an unbelievably fast pace .
There are lots of illnesses that are thinking incurable by the past vanished in the world .
Even though people with cancer , which is still hard to cure , now has more chance to survive and have a long time to live .
Besides illness , an improvement in technology generates more food both in quantity and quality .
In the same time , it also frees a great amount of labor .
Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoyed high-level food and even pursuing a tasty and luxury one .
It is a break-through in technology and science , and the outstanding achievements of human wisdom .
Making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and gave us more time to enjoy life , it sounds like perfect , but we must face the reality -- there is no utopia .
Before people find another planet to live , the earth is the only habitat for us , and hence the limits of its capacity to support living , it is a limit on the quantity of people that can live .
People 's lifetime rises meant that the timing of the cycle of generations rise .
Furthermore , thanks to the development of technology , that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing accelerates population ages and increases .
To our disappointment , now the technology is not so advanced that it can generate all human beings from using limited resources .
Moreover , the global population ages meant that the total amount and quality of labor is decreasing .
Before robots can fully replace Tabor , a decrease of generating power indicates less creativity and less goods available for us to use .
It is such a challenge that human beings could not avoid and must solve .
The only way is to develop technology but the chance to develop is based on people 's wisdom and creativity , which is decreasing due to population aging .
The world is always fair to us .
While we were celebrating the break-through at our way to utopia , we are suffering faces a new challenge .
We could not give up what we achieved in the past and following the natural way died and reborn .
Therefore , the only way available to us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development so to increase the capacity of our planet .
As for the world is becoming more and more advanced , people are leading more and more comfortable lives .
Moreover , the life expectancy have also been raised due to the developing in the economy .
However , while we were enjoying the fruits carried was the development of the economy , we are also facing a global problems --- population ageing .
There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious which have gradually influence the tendency of the population as well as the source allocation .
Therefore , the rising life expectancy could be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
On one side , we could not deny that it is a great achievement for a rising life expectancy .
The reason why the life expectancy has aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to evolution , and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned .
Since that we get richer , we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life .
Therefore , because of the great efforts we have made , we have been living the good life .
And that is what we are striving for .
So the rising life expectancy could be regarded as proof of what we have made of combat with ourselves .
On the other side , we have to say that obvious problems that we are facing is also caused by a rise in life expectancy .
Since that we had a good living circumstances and high living quality , we are leading a long life .
This seems to be a gratifying progress at first sight .
However , during the process of making development in our lives , we decided to reduce the rapid growth in population by adopting a measure of control birth so that a shortage of sourcing allocation can also be slowed down .
This also works and we have also seen the effect .
Then there came the problem .
Because that the birth rate is reducing while the death rate is also reduced , the percentage of elderly is increasing while that of the youth are decreasing .
So the population is getting more and more aged .
But the primary labor force as well as the work force is in the youth .
That is to say , the population aging has aggravated a burden to the society .
Then we can see that the rising life expectancy can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face .
Taken together , we should say that the rise in life expectancy is two sided .
It has shown that we are leading the good life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population ages .
However , an achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenge .
The significance of our existence was to lead a meaningful life and combat to the development of our world .
There is no absolute perfect way , so we have done a good job on the road .
Therefore , we need to continue with our striving as trying our best to reduce the adverse impact that was carrying .
Rising life expectancy is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life are increasing in both developed and developing countries .
However , it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environment .
It is well-known statistics that , generally , as the country develops a life expectancies increase .
This is the result of better quality of life ; which is basically sufficient food and clean water , good sanitation and advanced health-care .
With sufficient food , children will develop properly into adults .
Better sanitation would result in fewer deaths from infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses .
Advanced healthcare was also a major factor in prolonging the individual 's existence on earth .
Examples of how advanced health in the city has raised life expectancy is such as antibiotics , the cure of poliomyelitis , and better and clean surgical procedures .
All of these are human achievements in their own right that have resulted in rising life expectancy , and hence they also illustrates why rising expectancy could be considered an achievement .
It is remarkable that population aged 60 and over are increased by 2 % to 3 % annually in developing countries as well .
It is highly plausible that the result of increase were the same as the developed countries .
If that is true , it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries , albeit slowly .
Fewer famine , better sanitation and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century 's greatest achievement as a global society .
However , an ageing population are taxed in the country .
Although life expectancy may increase significantly , the population overall productivity may not increased linearly .
They will end up putting a burden on a society that they have been contributing their whole working career .
With falling birth rates , there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload .
In addition , an aging population will require more healthcare and treatment because one 's constitution weakened as one ages .
The challenge is how many lives could the society and community afforded to sustain ; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle .
Rising expectancy is also an environmental challenge because a good quality of life requires a lot of energy .
More food , clean water , good sanitation , and healthcare consumed large quantities of energy .
An example is the modern method of intense farming .
Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticide , and harvesting and transporting the food produced around the globe .
If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increased in order to keep increasing life expectancy , it will be continuing to have a huge impact on the environment .
The challenge will be increasing the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable .
The rising life expectancy can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is a by-product of rising quality of life ; bringing along its glories and its dirty little secrets .
At the present time , people are more concerned about their health .
There are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly , and more and more people choosing organic foods and eat balanced diet to make them healthier .
As a result , the current average life span is over 65 worldwide now .
By projections from the United Nations , it was shown that population aged more than 60 were increased by 2 % to 3 % of the developed and developing countries respectively .
The rising life expectancy is a big achievement for human beings .
However , as there is only limited space and resources on earth , rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide .
Rising life expectancy is a technology achievements .
Back in the ancient days , when human beings firstly appear in the earth , the average life expectancy is only less than 20 .
The reasons are mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions , the lack of food , lack of hygiene knowledge , and also very importantly , a lack of medicine .
With the development of society , to the past thousands of years , the technology is progressing and a concern for health is arising , so that higher life expectancy is achieved .
With more advanced technologies in medicine area , more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided .
Since people get higher education today , increasing amounts of people switch from fast food with organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chances of getting cancer are low .
Such situations are the major progress in ancient times and also a big achievement for all human beings .
However , since the space and resources on earth is very limited , high life expectancy means more people will live in the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable .
Since there are more people on the earth , more space is needed for people to live in , so that some farm land may be turned into buildings to accommodate more people .
However , the need for food is also increasing , so that the competition might become even more frightening .
What 's worse , since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have , violence may take place more frequently .
Many violence happens in Middle East was just due to a fight with food and water resources .
With more people living on the earth , pollution may become even serious , and as a result of pollution , the supply of food and water will decrease , so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve .
In a word , the rise in life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge to the whole human being .
The advanced technology has helped us to live longer , but the limited resources on earth is also a big challenge .
We should do our best to cooperate with each other and live in the same earth in harmony .
With the development of a modern society , people lives longer .
Statistics show that worldwide , the average life expectancy at birth is 66.57 year in 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009 .
In the developed countries like Japan and Switzerland , the life expectancy could be as high as more than 80 .
Normally , people will regard the extended life expectation as an achievement , and usually use such data as a measure for the development of the country .
However , as the population is ageing , the challenges such as increasing medical costs and shortage of workforce are also realized .
In a nut shell , rising life expectancy could be considered both the achievements and the challenge .
Indeed , thanks to improved living standards and medical care , countless people 's lives were extended .
No doubt life is the most precious treasure in human beings .
Without lives , we have nothing .
In the long history of the evolution , we were always struggling in life against staving and illness .
In last two centuries , we humans have made the greatest achievement in developing our society .
We are modernized and we have gained improved living standards and medical care .
We are no longer bothered by starving and common illnesses .
In ancient times , the residents may only live for 30 years ; but now , the life expectancy could be 80s in many countries .
With a doubled life time , humans could have changed to explore the real meaning of life .
There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man 's life .
Hence , the rising life expectancy no doubt can be considered as a great achievement .
On the other hand , the aging of populations can also be a challenge in a society .
When people grow old , they will be weak and get sick easily .
That is the natural laws which nobody could violate .
Hence , when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reached some certain points , a challenge in a society could not be neglected anymore .
First , the medical costs will rise greatly .
If an individual or family is to pay the bills , they could be bankrupt because of illness .
If the medical cost is covered by a government budget , the deficit will be a heavy burden affect the normal operation of the government .
Second , the shortage of workforce could also endanger the development of a society .
Japan society is now facing severe age problem , and the path of development is seriously slow .
There had been a report estimated that by the year 2060 , only half of the population in Japan is suitable for work .
The same situation is happening around the world .
Obviously , rising life expectancy should also be considered as a serious challenge .
To conclude , the rising life expectancy must be considered both the achievements and the challenge .
To extend our lives is not only a symbol of our achievements in developing our society , but also a fulfillment of our original dream .
At the same time , we also need to consider the negative effects brought about an ageing population , and then find proper measures to counter the challenge .
The population ageing is now a heated expression of individuals ' lives .
These two words can be seen in various media and assessment of this social trends were in great numbers .
When mentioning the population ageing , media always consider it as a social problem .
It is deniable that populations age can cause a lot of problems , but at the same time , it is also a symbol of improvement .
Therefore , population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
Following are the more specific explanation .
The rising average life expectancy can surely cause some problems .
Firstly , the ageing population is generally low productivity .
It is a natural ruled that when people grow old , their bodies would be less flexible and brain will operate slower , so they will contribute less to the society .
In addition , elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resources , as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weak physical status .
Furthermore , to make living , many senior citizens went back to work field .
It will also induce many problems .
For example , these senior citizens may do the work less efficient and which will lead to a low effective output .
To make him or her more competitive so that not being beaten by a young , old people usually accept lower compensation or bonuses .
This may lead to a young 's low employment rates and opportunity and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standards to reduce the daily costs .
Besides , the elderly of less salary also had to lower their living standards ; both the consequences could cause a decrease in social happiness levels and drove the whole society in a less stable situation .
There are also some older people living a rich life of their deposit and retirement compensation .
They can live a happy life , but actually in the society as a whole , it is a waste of social resources .
Also , a growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thought and mindsets which may become the resistance to a positive social change .
Above all , the population aging will be the great challenge for the world of it drags the development of a society .
However , the growing life expectancy also means the achievements of human society .
Actually , living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize .
There are many factors which would result in the deaths of people , such as natural disasters , accidents , disease or suicide .
Long life span of the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face a life full of problems .
For a whole society , rising life expectancy is a symbol of more advanced science and technology especially in the medical field , better social environment and a safer world .
Therefore , humans need to appreciate the longer life spans and consider it as an achievement .
Every coin has two sides .
The rising life expectancy is like a two sided sword in the modern world .
It can cause many problems but it also meant a lot to a human being .
What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and at the same time appreciating its great meaning .
Rising life expectancy , Not Only the achievements , But Also a challenge
According to recent research , population ageing is a global phenomenon and a current average life span is over 65 .
The rising life expectancy is not only an achievement , but also a great challenge .
Obviously , rising life expectancy is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospitalized technology , insurance conditions , cultured development , and our social system , which showed the improvements to people 's lives quality .
Thanks to the development of technology and society , some deadly diseases in the past are curable now , and people are more aware of how to take care of our bodies .
This is a great achievement made for a generation .
At the same time , it is also a great challenge .
With the population aging and an increasing portion of the old people , we are facing lots of problems now .
For individuals , since people 's life expectancies are becoming longer , there will be more trouble for them to take care of themselves , especially for those who live alone or having disease and are poor .
For example , it became hard for them to earn their livings ; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses die ; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases .
And they may not get as much attention to their families as before .
For families , certainly , the burden of young people being became heavier .
In China , lots of families only have one child .
That means when the child grows up , they need to take care of both parents .
One family at least should take care of four old people .
For a few groups of families , there is even up to eight old people since their grandparents were also lived with them .
Besides financial burdens , they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them .
These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children .
For society , when a group of old people became larger and less people can work for the society , this society may lack in labour .
And at the same time , these old people take up a large portion of resources and budge in this society .
To some degree , it would delay the economic development in the world .
Besides , society needs to figure out more policies to secure old people 's lives .
Also , the population aged called for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology , high levels of civilizations in our lives .
If our spiritual aspect of civilization could not match our material aspects , old people will have a tough twilight years .
Now population aging is a trend .
It is an achievement for our society , but it is also a great challenge called us to face a new situation .
Population ageing seems to be an achievement when it first happened .
In the old time , people could easily lose their lives due to hunger , disease , government , war or something else .
After the country was just found , some immature policies led to a nationwide hunger .
Millions of people could not find food to eat and end up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen .
There are everywhere wandering people trying to find food .
Some people even eat their own dead children .
There is a saying which said that hunger can bring people back to animals .
Infectious diseases is also a life killer .
Not long from now SARS , as blurry as it is , attacking people all around the world .
Since no one knew about this disease before , it spread around the whole world before humans took action .
The spreading speed is so fast that plenty of people die before knowing about it .
An atmosphere of death cover the whole world .
The expression of desperation could be seen everywhere .
The war killed a lot of people , which is not doubtful .
After going through a WW1 and WW2 , the population of the earth gets much fewer .
No matter because the technology was not developed enough or because there are wars and battles one after another , people just do n't living a long life .
Hence , as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated , people do n't risked their lives anymore .
People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood to battle and with more and more perfect medical insurance .
The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today .
Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still faced a lack of medical insurance , the world at all is getting better in the field .
With modern machines and growing methods , humans do n't need to worry about the amount of food anymore .
All the achievement humans make influenced the lifespan of people .
That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement .
Population ageing is not all on the good side of the society though .
As a society develops , people gradually found that population aging brings us many problems .
With more and more people not working at all and receive an allowance by the government , the society 's balance is broken .
It was difficult to keep economy function well .
Times change , people change .
Many young people do n't view things like their parents used to do .
Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before .
This problem is very common in developing countries .
With more perfect system for the old and more modern equipment , population ageing always comes first .
The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem .
For example , they encourage people to have more children of awarding them .
They pull up the age to retire .
No matter what measures they take , the population aged still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies .
